# Introduction

The Open Video UI provides component libraries for building a world-class video player experience powered by the THEOplayer SDK.

- Use the default UI for a great out-of-the-box experience, or use the individual components to build your own custom UI.
- Dedicated libraries for each platform, so your UI always feels native in your app.

On these pages, you'll learn how to get started with the Open Video UI and make your very own UI.
