# Getting started

## Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

1. This project requires the THEOplayer Web SDK to be installed.

   <!-- -->

   ```sh
   npm install theoplayer

   ```

   <!-- -->

   You can also install a different variant of the THEOplayer npm package if you don't need all features, as long as it's aliased as `theoplayer`.

   <!-- -->

   ```sh
   npm install theoplayer@npm:@theoplayer/basic-hls

   ```

2. Install the Open Video UI for React.
   <!-- -->
   ```sh
   npm install @theoplayer/react-ui

   ```

3. Add `@theoplayer/react-ui` to your app:
   <!-- -->
   ```jsx
   import { DefaultUI } from '@theoplayer/react-ui';

   ```
   <!-- -->
   Open Video UI will import THEOplayer from `theoplayer/chromeless`. If you're using a bundler such as Webpack or Rollup, this dependency should automatically get bundled with your web app.

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

### Default UI[​](#default-ui "Direct link to Default UI")

`<DefaultUI>` provides a fully-featured video player experience with minimal setup, and allows for small customizations such as changing colors or fonts.

```tsx
import { DefaultUI } from '@theoplayer/react-ui';
import type { ChromelessPlayer } from 'theoplayer/chromeless';

const App = () => {
    // Configure THEOplayer
    const configuration = {
        libraryLocation: '/path/to/node_modules/theoplayer/',
        license: 'your_theoplayer_license_goes_here'
    };
    // Configure a source for the player to play
    const source = {
        sources: {
            src: 'https://example.com/stream.m3u8'
        }
    };
    // Optionally, access the underlying THEOplayer player instance
    const onReady = (player: ChromelessPlayer) => {
        player.addEventListener('playing', () => console.log('THEOplayer is now playing'));
    };

    return <DefaultUI configuration={configuration} source={source} onReady={onReady} />;
};

```

### Custom UI[​](#custom-ui "Direct link to Custom UI")

If you want to fully customize your video player layout, you can use a `<UIContainer>` instead.

```tsx
import { ControlBar, MuteButton, PlayButton, TimeRange, VolumeRange } from '@theoplayer/react-ui';

const App = () => {
    const configuration = {
        libraryLocation: '/path/to/node_modules/theoplayer/',
        license: 'your_theoplayer_license_goes_here'
    };
    const source = {
        sources: {
            src: 'https://example.com/stream.m3u8'
        }
    };

    return (
        <UIContainer
            configuration={configuration}
            source={source}
            bottomChrome={
                <>
                    {/* Choose your own layout using the provided components (or your own!) */}
                    <ControlBar>
                        <TimeRange />
                    </ControlBar>
                    <ControlBar>
                        <PlayButton />
                        <MuteButton />
                        <VolumeRange />
                    </ControlBar>
                </>
            }
        />
    );
};

```

See [this page](/documentation/pr-preview/pr-690/open-video-ui/react/examples/custom-ui.md) for a complete example.

### Legacy browser support[​](#legacy-browser-support "Direct link to Legacy browser support")

By default, Open Video UI for React targets modern browsers that support modern JavaScript syntax (such as [async/await](https://caniuse.com/async-functions)) and native [Custom Elements](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1). This keeps the download size small, so your viewers can spend less time waiting for your page to load and start watching their video faster.

On older browsers (such as Internet Explorer 11 and older smart TVs), you need to load a different version of the Open Video UI that uses older JavaScript syntax. You also need to load additional polyfills for missing features such as `Promise`, `Symbol.iterator` or Custom Elements:

* For ES2015 features like `Promise` and `Symbol.iterator`, we recommend [the Cloudflare mirror of Polyfill.io](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/).
* For Custom Elements, we recommend loading our polyfill bundle from `@theoplayer/web-ui/polyfills`. Alternatively, you can load the [Web Components Polyfills](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills) along with [Lit's `polyfill-support` module](https://lit.dev/docs/v2/tools/requirements/#polyfills).

The simplest way to do this is to load the legacy build instead:

```tsx
import '@theoplayer/web-ui/polyfills';
import { DefaultUI } from '@theoplayer/react-ui/es5'; // note the "/es5" suffix

```

However, this will load unnecessary polyfills in modern browsers, which is suboptimal. Instead, we recommend configuring your bundler to produce a modern and legacy build of your entire web app, and to import the appropriate version of Open Video UI for each build flavor.
