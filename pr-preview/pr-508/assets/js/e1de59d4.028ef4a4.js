Ads are often sourced from master media files such as high bitrate MP4 or MOV files. Sometimes the master media files is referenced in a VAST (Video Ad Serving Template) file. Or, the ad may actually already be in an HLS format, but you need to convert it to a different bitrate ladder. On the delivery side, you may want to create a single MP4 file or a multi-bitrate HLS file. You may want to create an HLS, but have that HLS be referenced in a VAST file. All of these different types of conformance can be executed by the OptiView Ad Engine:","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/ad-delivery":{"id":"how-to/ad-delivery","title":"Ad Delivery","description":"You have multiple ways that your ad can be delivered as part of the ad conformance process. The OptiView Ad Engine can directly act as the origin, or you can have the Ad Engine place the finished files into your own origin (e.g. in your cloud or on your CDN).","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/ad-profile-creation":{"id":"how-to/ad-profile-creation","title":"Ad Profiles","description":"Before any ads can be processed by the OptiView Ad Engine, you must create one or more ad profiles. The purpose of an ad profile is to define the parameters of your encoding, such as resolution, bitrate, etc. This is also where you define the audio normalization you desire and any quality control checks that should be performed.","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/audio-assignment":{"id":"how-to/audio-assignment","title":"ABR Audio Assignment","description":"You can create multiple audio bitrates in HLS, and then assign different bitrates to different video renditions. For example, on your 1080p high bitrate video you may have audio at 128kbps, whereas on your small 360p video you may only want audio at 64kbps. This allows you to minimize the combined video/audio bitrate for certain streams.","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/audio-normalization":{"id":"how-to/audio-normalization","title":"Audio Normalization","description":"An area of importance for ad processing is to have the ads match the source content in terms of audio volume. It will drive away viewers if your ads have wildly different volume than your primary content. Whether by accident or intent, ads are often set to very high volume. You can use the OptiView Ad Engine to normalize these ads so that all your ads are (1) consistent and (2) match your primary content.","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/cloud-preview":{"id":"how-to/cloud-preview","title":"Cloud Preview","description":"There is typically a significant difference between high-quality media masters and content intended for streaming. Media masters are not only extremely high bitrate, but are often stored in formats (for example, QuickTime ProRes) that are not streamable.","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/image":{"id":"how-to/image","title":"Image Generation","description":"The Image API provides a simple way to extract a single image frame from a media asset stored in the cloud. It is commonly used to generate images without downloading or transcoding the full media file.","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/media-info":{"id":"how-to/media-info","title":"Media Info","description":"The Media Info endpoint provides a fast, normalized view of the technical characteristics of a media asset stored in the cloud. The Media Info API inspects a media file and returns a structured JSON response describing the container, duration, bitrate, and all detected tracks (video, audio, timecode, and others).","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/quality-control":{"id":"how-to/quality-control","title":"Ad Quality Control","description":"One of the realities of ads is that there are many instances where the ad source can be problematic. These types of problems can include things like too long duration, too short duration, too small dimensions, too low of a bitrate, etc. A bad ad can look bad, sound bad, or simply stall your player, so it is important to verify the quality of the ad.","sidebar":"adengine"},"how-to/upconvert-to-vision-atmos":{"id":"how-to/upconvert-to-vision-atmos","title":"Up-Converting Ads to Dolby Vision and Atmos","description":"The vast majority of ads are produced in SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) video and stereo audio. Many premium VOD and live assets are delivered, however, in Dolby Vision and Atmos. Dolby Vision is the leading HDR (High Dynamic Range) format and Dolby Atmos is the leading object-oriented audio format. You can optimize the viewing experience for your customers by up-converting the ad video and audio to match the primary content. Converting the ad video to Dolby Vision gives the ad more color depth and makes it look stunning. And most importantly, viewers are not switching back and forth between HDR primary content and SDR ads.","sidebar":"adengine"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Dolby OptiView Ad Engine","description":"The OptiView Ad Engine is a just-in-time, serverless conformance service that transforms ads from their original master format into a streaming format that matches the primary content stream. This ensures smooth, consistent ad playback, improving the overall viewing experience and enhancing audience satisfaction. Because the Ad Engine operates just-in-time, it can prepare ads for playback within the span of an Early Ad Break Notification (EABN). The Ad Engine is compatible with any ad server, streaming engine, or player. Beyond transforming ads, it can also be used to integrate other types of content, such as editorial segments.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/cloud-preview-codemill":{"id":"reference/cloud-preview-codemill","title":"Cloud Preview - Codemill","description":"Generates Accurate Player templates for instant cloud asset media playback.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/cloud-preview-hls":{"id":"reference/cloud-preview-hls","title":"Cloud Preview - HLS","description":"Generates HLS Preview templates for instant cloud asset media playback.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/cloud-preview-omakase":{"id":"reference/cloud-preview-omakase","title":"Cloud Preview - Omakase","description":"Generates Omakase Player Session templates for instant cloud asset media playback.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/conform-ad":{"id":"reference/conform-ad","title":"Conform Ad","description":"Conforms a single ad to a specified encoding profile.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/conform-ad-pod":{"id":"reference/conform-ad-pod","title":"Conform Ad Pod","description":"Conforms multiple ads (an ad pod) to a specified encoding profile.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/create-ad-profile":{"id":"reference/create-ad-profile","title":"Create Ad Profile","description":"Creates an ad encoding profile.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/delete-ad-profile":{"id":"reference/delete-ad-profile","title":"Delete Ad Profile","description":"Deletes a specific ad profile.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/dolby-optiview-ad-engine":{"id":"reference/dolby-optiview-ad-engine","title":"Dolby OptiView Ad Engine","description":""},"reference/get-ad-profile":{"id":"reference/get-ad-profile","title":"Get Ad Profile","description":"Requests the properties of a specific ad profile.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/image":{"id":"reference/image","title":"Image","description":"Image","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/list-ad-profiles":{"id":"reference/list-ad-profiles","title":"Get All Ad Profiles","description":"Gets a list of all current ad profiles.","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/media-info":{"id":"reference/media-info","title":"Media Info","description":"Media Info","sidebar":"adengine"},"reference/update-ad-profile":{"id":"reference/update-ad-profile","title":"Update Ad Profile","description":"Updates an ad encoding profile.","sidebar":"adengine"}}}}')}}]);
