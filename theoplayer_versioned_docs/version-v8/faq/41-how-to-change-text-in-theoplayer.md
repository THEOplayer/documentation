# How to change text in THEOplayer

Using language localization, you should be able to change any text in the player to the one you desire.

Language localization is not limited to only translating. It can also be used to change any text in the player.

You can change the language localization in the player configuration.

```js
ui: {
      // your other ui configuration
      language: 'fr',
      languages: { 'fr':
                          {
                           "Something went wrong during native playback." : "Insert your desired text here"
                           // any other translation
                           }
                     }
      }
```
