## How to use the Up Next API

The Up Next API is a UI feature and shows video chapters when hovering the timeline.

### Prerequisites

This guide expects that you have a THEOplayer license. If you aren't using THEOplayer yet, you can start your free trial [here](https://portal.theoplayer.com). Be sure to have THEOplayer version 2.11 or higher.

### Adding a chapter markers track

In order to add chapter markers, you need to add a TextTrackDescription to your source that specifies a sideloaded text track of kind 'chapters'. THEOplayer supports loading of chapter markers in WebVTT, SRT and other text track formats.

To see an example of chapter markers in WebVTT formats, check out the article [What are chapter markers?](../../../knowledge-base/03-playback/01-what-are-chapter-markers.md).

### Code samples

The following code samples show how you can load THEOplayer with a video and sideloaded chapters track:

##### Web SDK

This example shows how to use chapters on your video. In this example, the source contains one `TextTrack` object, including a WebVTT file with video chapters.

```js
player.source = {
    ...
    textTracks : [{
        kind : 'chapters',
        src : 'https://cdn.theoplayer.com/video/sintel/chapters.vtt',
        srclang : 'en'
    }]
};
```

##### Android SDK

The following example shows how to use chapters on your video. In this example, the source contains one `TextTrack` object, including a WebVTT file with video chapters.

```java
sourceDescription(
    typedSource("https://cdn.theoplayer.com/video/sintel/nosubs.m3u8")
        .build()
)
.textTracks(
    new TextTrackDescription(
        src: "https://cdn.theoplayer.com/video/sintel/chapters.vtt",
        isDefault: true,
        TextTrackKind.CHAPTERS,
        srclang: "en",
        label: "Chapters")
)
```

##### iOS/tvOS SDK and Legacy iOS/tvOS SDK (4.12.x)

A `TextTrackDescription` object has the following constructor:

```swift
TextTrackDescription(src: String,
                     srclang: String,
                     isDefault: Bool?,
                     kind: TextTrackKind?,
                     label: String?,
                     format: TextTrackFormat?)
```

The following example shows how to use chapters on your video. In this example, the source contains one `TextTrack` object, including a WebVTT file with video chapters.

Example code:

```swift
var textTrackDescription = TextTrackDescription(src: "https://cdn.theoplayer.com/video/sintel/chapters.vtt",
                                                srclang: "en",
                                                kind: .chapters)
}

var sourceDescription = SourceDescription(source: TypedSource(src: "https://cdn.theoplayer.com/video/elephants-dream/playlist.m3u8",
                                                              type: "application/x-mpegurl"),
                                          textTracks: [textTrackDescription])
)
```
