# Migrating from deprecated THEOlive player to THEOplayer on Web

The goal of this guide is to help you migrate from the deprecated [theolive player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theolive/player)
to the recommended [THEOplayer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/theoplayer). If you haven't integrated with any player,
please follow the [recommended](00-getting-started.mdx) guide instead of this one.

## Dependencies

First remove the old player dependency:

```
npm uninstall @theolive/player
```

And replace with theoplayer using:

```
npm install theoplayer
```

## Setting up a player

Player creation is quite similar, instead of

```javascript
const player = new THEOLive.Player(element);
```

Create the player like this:

```javascript
var player = new THEOplayer.Player(element, {
  license: 'your-license',
  // This is needed for fallback to work properly
  retryConfiguration: {
    maxRetries: 6,
  },
  theoLive: {
    // these are optional
    externalSessionId: 'my-external-session-id',
    fallbackEnabled: true,
  },
});
```

Note that you now need a license, either use the THEOplayer license you had before, or use the one provided in the
[THEOlive console](https://console.theo.live) when creating a channel.

## Loading a channel

After setting up your THEOplayer on your web page, we will set the source to a channel. The old way was calling loadChannel
on the player.

```javascript
player.loadChannel('<your-channel-id>').catch(console.error);
```

With THEOplayer you just set a [SourceDescription](pathname:///theoplayer/v8/api-reference/web/interfaces/TheoLiveSource.html).

```javascript
player.source = {
  sources: {
    type: 'theolive',
    src: 'your-channel-id',
  },
};
```

## Calling methods and listening to events

Most of the old functionality is right there on THEOplayer and can be found in the [THEOplayer docs](pathname:///theoplayer/v8/api-reference/web/classes/ChromelessPlayer.html). For THEOlive specific
API, check out [player.theolive](pathname:///theoplayer/v8/api-reference/web/interfaces/TheoLiveApi.html).
