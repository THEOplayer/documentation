# Getting started with the Conviva Connector for the Roku SDK

Here's how to get started integrating the Conviva Connector with the THEOplayer Roku SDK.

## Prerequisites

In order to set up the Conviva Connector in your Roku application, you'll need the following:

- Your Conviva customer key (available in your Conviva Pulse dashboard)
- An app with the THEOPlayer SDK for Roku already integrated, see our [Getting Started guide](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/roku/getting-started/).
- Optionally for debug and testing, your Conviva Touchstone gateway URL, which should be in the format of `"https://MY_TOUCHSTONE_DOMAIN.ts-testonly.conviva.com/"`

## Integration

1. First you must download the THEO Conviva Connector as a component library. Add a ComponentLibrary node to your MainScene.brs file, giving it an id of `THEOConvivaConnector` and providing the URI for the THEOConvivaConnector.pkg:

```xml
<ComponentLibrary id="THEOConvivaConnector" uri="https://cdn.myth.theoplayer.com/roku/1.5.0/THEOConvivaConnector.pkg" />
```

2. Then in the Brightscript file for your MainScene, listen for the loading of the ComponentLibrary to complete by observing the `loadStatus` field.

```brightscript
sub Init()
    THEOConvivaNode = m.top.findNode("THEOConvivaConnector")
    THEOConvivaNode.observeField("loadStatus", "onLibraryLoadStatusChanged")
end sub

sub onLibraryLoadStatusChanged(event as object)
    THEOConvivaNode = event.getROSGNode()

    if THEOConvivaNode = invalid
        return
    end if

    if THEOConvivaNode.loadStatus = "ready"
		' Success
    else if THEOConvivaNode.loadStatus = "failed"
		? "Failed to load component library, please check URL. "; THEOConvivaNode.uri
	end if
end sub
```

3. Add the THEOConvivaConnector component to the SceneGraph file where your THEOPlayer is defined

```xml
<THEOsdk:THEOplayer id="THEOplayer" controls="true" />
<THEOConvivaConnector:THEOConvivaConnector id="THEOConvivaConnector" />
```

4. Then in the Brightscript file, configure the connector by calling the configure method, passing the player instance and your Conviva customer key.

```brightscript
m.player = m.top.findNode("THEOPlayer")
m.convivaConnector = m.top.findNode("THEOConvivaConnector")
m.convivaConnector.callFunc("configure", m.player, "MY_CUSTOMER_KEY")
```

NOTE: that if you want to debug first and use Conviva's Touchstone service to validate your integration, you can include the gateway URL and a debug parameter in the configure call:
`m.convivaConnector.callFunc("configure", m.player, "MY_CUSTOMER_KEY", "MY_TOUCHSTONE_GATEWAY_URL", true)`

5. Next, when you start playing the asset, call the `startSession` method and pass it the content metadata for the asset you're playing:

```brightscript
m.player.source = sourceDescription
contentMetadata = {
    defaultReportingResource: "MyCDN",
    playerName: "My Player",
    assetName: "My Asset Name",
    encodedFramerate: 24
}
m.convivaConnector.callFunc("startSession", contentMetadata)
```

See the [API documentation](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/connectors/roku/conviva/API-reference/) for more on how to structure the content metadata for Conviva.

6. If you desire to monitor for CDN changes, you can optionally add a configuration for that after starting the session.
   `m.convivaConnector.callFunc("monitorCdnChanges", { mycdn: ["my-cdn.net"], theo: ["cdn.theoplayer.com"] })`
7. If the content metadata needs to change, you can update it by calling `setContentInfo`. This method accepts partial content metadata:
   `m.convivaConnector.callFunc( "setContentInfo", {assetName: "New Program"})`
8. When the video has stopped playing because it ended or the user exited, end the Conviva session
   `m.convivaConnector.callFunc("endSession")`
9. If you are exiting the player screen altogether, and destroying the player, make sure to destroy the connector at the same time, but before calling destroy on the SDK:

```brightscript
m.convivaConnector.callFunc("destroy")
m.convivaConnector = invalid

m.player.callFunc("destroy")
m.player = invalid
```
