# Getting started with the Adobe Edge Connector for the Roku SDK

Here's how to get started integrating the Adobe Edge Connector with the THEOplayer Roku SDK.

## Prerequisites

In order to set up the Adobe Edge Connector in your Roku application, you'll need the following:

- Your Adobe Edge domain and config ID (also known as data stream ID)
- An app with the THEOPlayer SDK for Roku already integrated, see our [Getting Started guide](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/roku/getting-started/).

## Integration

1. First you must download the THEO Adobe Edge Connector as a component library. Add a ComponentLibrary node to your MainScene.brs file, giving it an id of `THEOAEPConnector` and providing the URI for the THEOAEPConnector.pkg:

```xml
<ComponentLibrary id="THEOAEPConnector" uri="https://cdn.myth.theoplayer.com/roku/9.1.0/THEOAEPConnector.pkg" />
```

2. Then in the Brightscript file for your MainScene, listen for the loading of the ComponentLibrary to complete by observing the `loadStatus` field.

```brightscript
sub Init()
    THEOAEPNode = m.top.findNode("THEOAEPConnector")
    THEOAEPNode.observeField("loadStatus", "onLibraryLoadStatusChanged")
end sub

sub onLibraryLoadStatusChanged(event as object)
    THEOAEPNode = event.getROSGNode()

    if THEOAEPNode = invalid
        return
    end if

    if THEOAEPNode.loadStatus = "ready"
		' Success
    else if THEOAEPNode.loadStatus = "failed"
		? "Failed to load component library, please check URL. "; THEOAEPNode.uri
	end if
end sub
```

3. Add the THEOAEPConnector component to the SceneGraph file where your THEOPlayer is defined

```xml
<THEOsdk:THEOplayer id="THEOplayer" controls="true" />
<THEOAEPConnector:THEOAEPConnector id="THEOAEPConnector" />
```

4. Then in the Brightscript file, configure the connector by calling the configure method, passing the player instance and your Adobe Edge configuration.

```brightscript
m.player = m.top.findNode("THEOPlayer")
m.aepConnector = m.top.findNode("THEOAEPConnector")
aepConfig = {
    configId: "<MY_AEP_CONFIG_ID>",
    domainName: "<MY_EDGE_DOMAIN>",
    mediaChannel: "My Channel",
    mediaPlayerName: "My Player",
    mediaAppVersion: "1.0",
    logLevel: 3
}
m.aepConnector.callFunc("configure", m.player, aepConfig)
```

5. Next, when you start playing the asset, call the `startSession` method and pass it the session details for the asset you're playing. You may also include an optional session configuration:

```brightscript
m.player.source = sourceDescription

aepSessionConfig = {}
aepSessionConfig["config.channel"] = "My Channel"
aepSessionConfig["config.adpinginterval"] = 5
aepSessionConfig["config.mainpinginterval"] = 30

aepSessionDetails = {
    name: "my-asset-id",
    friendlyName: sourceDescription.title,
    contentType: "video",
    streamType: "vod",
    length: 300,
    customMetadata: {
        key1: "value1",
        key2: "value2",
    }
}
m.aepConnector.callFunc("startSession", aepSessionDetails, aepSessionConfig)
```

See the [API documentation](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-roku/blob/main/Documentation/api-reference.md) for more on how to structure the data for Adobe Edge.

6. When the video has stopped playing because it ended or the user exited, end the Adobe Edge session.
   `m.aepConnector.callFunc("endSession")`
7. If you are exiting the player screen altogether, and destroying the player, make sure to destroy the connector at the same time, but before calling destroy on the SDK:

```brightscript
m.aepConnector.callFunc("destroy")
m.aepConnector = invalid

m.player.callFunc("destroy")
m.player = invalid
```
