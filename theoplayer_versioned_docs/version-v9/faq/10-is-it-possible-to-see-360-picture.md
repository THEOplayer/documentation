# Is it possible to see 360 degrees photo with THEOplayer

This question is asked by those users and developers that are wondering if the player 360 degree functionality can be used to view also images.

No, this cannot be done. The player is intended for video sources, so an image as input is not officially supported, which is also true for 3D images.
