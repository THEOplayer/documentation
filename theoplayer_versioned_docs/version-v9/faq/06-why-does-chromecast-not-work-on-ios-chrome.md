# Why does Chromecast not work on iOS Chrome?

iOS Chrome used to support Chromecast. However, Google silently removed support for it at some point. It is also documented [on their Web Sender guide here](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/web_sender) that:

You can still implement Chromecast inside a native iOS app following our guide [here](../how-to-guides/03-cast/01-chromecast/06-enable-chromecast-on-the-sender.md).
