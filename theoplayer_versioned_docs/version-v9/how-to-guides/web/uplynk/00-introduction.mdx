Uplynk is formerly known as **Verizon Media** and **Edgio**. We are moving away from any Verizon Media references in our
API. These are now marked as deprecated and should be replaced by the Uplynk API.

:::

Uplynk offers services which can enhance the API, UI and UX of video players and applications. The most popular services are called _Preplay_, _Ping_ and _Asset Info_. THEOplayer integrates these services so that developers and viewers can benefit from them.

For example,

- Viewers can skip over ads;
- Viewers can see when an ad is playing (and stopping);
- Developers can define the behavior when viewers try to seek over an ad;
- Developers can query metadata to render a playlist in their application.

A live demo of THEOplayer's integration of Uplynk is available [here](https://cdn.theoplayer.com/demos/verizon-media/index.html).
