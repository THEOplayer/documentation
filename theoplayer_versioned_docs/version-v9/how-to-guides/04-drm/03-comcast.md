# Comcast

This article describes how to configure Comcast DRM with THEOplayer. Head to our page on [DRM](../../how-to-guides/04-drm/00-introduction.md) for more general information.

## SDKs

| Web SDK |                  Android SDK                  |                    iOS SDK                    |                   tvOS SDK                    |                Android TV SDK                 | Chromecast SDK |
| :-----: | :-------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: | :------------: |
|   Yes   | Unverified through CSS/JavaScript injection\* | Unverified through CSS/JavaScript injection\* | Unverified through CSS/JavaScript injection\* | Unverified through CSS/JavaScript injection\* |   Unverified   |

\*CSS/JavaScript injection in the project is only possible with the legacy mobile SDKs (up to 4.12.X).

## Code examples

##### Web SDK

```js
if (HLS) {
  let drmConfiguration = {
    integration: 'comcast',
    fairplay: {
      licenseAcquisitionURL: '<LICENSE_KEY_URL_FAIRPLAY>',
      certificateURL: 'CERTIFICATE_URL>',
      token: '<TOKEN>',
      releasePid: '<RELEASEPID>',
      accountId: '<ACCOUNT_ID>',
    },
  };
  player.source = {
    sources: {
      src: '<HLS_STREAM_URL>',
      type: 'application/x-mpegurl',
      contentProtection: drmConfiguration,
    },
  };
} else if (DASH) {
  let drmConfiguration = {
    playready: {
      licenseAcquisitionURL: '<LICENSE_KEY_URL_PLAYREADY>',
    },
    widevine: {
      licenseAcquisitionURL: '<LICENSE_KEY_URL_WIDEVINE>',
    },
  };
  player.source = {
    sources: {
      src: '<DASH_STREAM_URL>',
      type: 'application/dash+xml',
      contentProtection: drmConfiguration,
    },
  };
}
```

##### Android SDK

There currently is no integration available in the Android SDK for this DRM system.

Legacy SDK (4.12.X): The Web SDK code should be included in your Android (TV) project. The article at [How to add CSS or JavaScript files to an Android/iOS project](../../../version-v4/faq/01-how-to-add-css-or-javascript-files-to-android-ios.md) explains how you can add CSS and JavaScript files to your project. The sample project at [How to insert a button](../../how-to-guides/11-ui/07-how-to-insert-a-button.md) demonstrates this.

##### iOS/tvOS SDK

There currently is no integration available in the iOS SDK for this DRM system.

Legacy SDK (4.12.X): The Web SDK code should be included in your iOS (TV) project. The article at [How to add CSS or JavaScript files to an Android/iOS project](../../../version-v4/faq/01-how-to-add-css-or-javascript-files-to-android-ios.md) explains how you can add CSS and JavaScript files to your project. The sample project at [How to insert a button](../../how-to-guides/11-ui/07-how-to-insert-a-button.md) demonstrates this.

## Connectors

We are developing open-source DRM connectors that can more easily be maintained and to allow for a modular approach. You can find them in [this Github repo](https://github.com/THEOplayer/samples-drm-integration), alongside with guides on how to integrate and use them.
When integrating DRM for the first time or updating your integration, the connectors are to be preferred over the pre-integrations.

**Web**
The Comcast DRM connector can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/THEOplayer/samples-drm-integration/tree/master/web/src/integration/comcastdrm).

**Mobile SDKs**
Connectors are also the way forward for the current mobile SDKs. There currently is no ready-made connector for this DRM provider: you can choose to develop one based on the examples in the repository, or get in contact with us about making one.

## Remarks

- Legacy Mobile SDKs (4.12.X): having this work through JavaScript injection has several limitations (e.g.: this will not work with Exoplayer on Android).
