# How to insert subtitles?

You may be asking this question if you need captions or subtitles on your video. The sourceDescription property _textTracks_ can be used to add an array of side-loaded text tracks to the player. All valid tracks will be available for playback as long as the playerâ€™s source is not set again. In the following guide, you will find several related topics and some code samples for different SDKs.

The _textTracks_ property and objects can also be used for other purposes, e.g.: for including preview thumbnails and chapters. Please see linked documentation and article to find out more.

## Code examples

##### Web SDK

Each text track should be described as a [TextTrackDescription](pathname:///theoplayer/v4/api-reference/web/interfaces/TextTrackDescription.html).

```js
player.source = {
  sources: [
    {
      src: "//path/to/your-manifest.m3u8", // sets source
      type: "application/x-mpegurl" // sets type - find other values at https://support.theoplayer.com/hc/en-us/articles/214350425-SourceDescription-API#TypedSource
    }
  ],
  textTracks: [
    {
      default: true, //optional
      kind: "subtitles", //optional - find other values at https://support.theoplayer.com/hc/en-us/articles/214350425#TextTrackDescription
      label: "English subs", //optional - this will appear in your UI
      src: "path/to/your-subs-track1.vtt",
      srclang: "en"
    }
  ]
};
```

##### Android SDK

```java
public static final SourceDescription SOURCE_WITH_SUBS =
        new SourceDescription.Builder("//path/to/your-manifest.m3u8")
            .textTracks(
                new TextTrackDescription.Builder("path/to/your-subs-track1.vtt")
                    .isDefault(true)
                    .kind(TextTrackKind.SUBTITLES)
                    .srclang("en")
                    .label("en")
                    .build()
            ).build()
```

##### iOS/tvOS SDK and Legacy iOS/tvOS SDK (4.12.x)

```swift
var sampleSource: SourceDescription {
        let src = "https://your.m3u8"
        let stream = "application/x-mpegurl"
        let textTrack1 = TextTrackDescription(src: "https://your.webvtt", srclang: "English", isDefault: true, kind: .subtitles, label:"English", format: .WebVTT)
        let textTrack2 = TextTrackDescription(src: "https://your.webvtt", srclang: "Arabic", isDefault: false, kind: .subtitles, label:"Arabic", format: .WebVTT)

        return SourceDescription(
            source: TypedSource(
                src: src,
                type: stream
            ),
            textTracks: [textTrack1,textTrack2]
        )
    }

Then set the source to the player by:

self.theoplayer.source = sampleSource
```

## Subtitle styling

To style your subtitles look into the player source property `textTrackStyle`.
