# Is it possible to preload VOD content while the pre-roll is playing

Yes, it is done with the preload feature. Before setting your source, you need to activate preload on your player. We advise to use the value ‘auto’: this allows the first segments of the stream to be downloaded during the ad, reducing the start-up time of the video content.
