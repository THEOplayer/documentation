# Why doesn't Chromecast work when embedded in an iframe on iOS?

This cannot work, because iOS + Chrome + iframe + Chromecast is technically not possible due to Apple's restrictions. When you visit the page embedded in the iframe, the Chromecast feature works as expected.

When placing other players in an iframe (e.g. YouTube, Dailymotion) they also lose their Chromecast capabilities.
