# What is the support for Wowza

Wowza and THEOplayer are partners in the streaming industry. When developers use both products,
* Wowza Streaming Cloud is used on the back-end to manage live streams.
* THEOplayer is used on the client-side to playout the live streams.

In this set-up, THEOplayer can play out the streams hosted by Wowza.
