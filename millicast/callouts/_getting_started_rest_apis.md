:::tip Getting Started with REST APIs

Review the REST API [Getting Started](/millicast/getting-started/using-rest-apis.mdx) tutorial for details on retrieving your API Key for authenticating your API calls. The examples included here use the `cURL` command-line utility. Alternatively, there are [Postman Collections](https://www.postman.com/dolbyio/dolby-io-streaming-apis/) and a [REST Client for Node](https://github.com/DolbyIO/dolbyio-rest-apis-client-node) that may be helpful for your project.
