Impose limits on who may use a token to broadcast or view a stream by defining rules based on the domain name or IP address in which the request originated. **Allowed Origins** enables defining specific domain names or sub-domain patterns that any request must originate from. Similarly, with **IP Address Filters** you can define rules that limit access by specifying the network IP address.

These approaches are sometimes referred to as _whitelisting_, a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized access. Even when token credentials are provided, if the domain or IP address does not originate from an expected network location, permission is denied. These types of access restrictions allow only specific known hosts or applications to broadcast with a [publish](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/managing-your-tokens.md) token or playback using a [subscribe](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/subscribe-tokens.md) token.

## Allowed origins

Setting up allowed origins as a means of [access control](/millicast/distribution/access-control/index.md) is done by specifying the domain where a request will originate. If you have deployed a website or application to a cloud provider you may not know the IP address of a server but any usage of a token can be restricted to the domain name for your application.

- A single domain: `millicast.com`
- Multiple domains comma delimited: `millicast.com, streaming.dolby.io`
- Wildcard domains: `*.dolby.io`

This approach helps prevent unauthorized usage of tokens.

### How-to set allowed domains using the dashboard

You can manage allowed origins by changing settings from the user interface of the [Streaming Dashboard](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/index.md).

:::tip Getting Started
If you haven't already, begin by following the [Getting Started](/millicast/introduction-to-streaming-apis.mdx) tutorial to create a Dolby.io application and start your first broadcast. You will need to have a publishing token. See [Managing Your Tokens](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/managing-your-tokens.md) for more details about tokens.
:::

Open the Live Broadcast section of the Dolby.io Dashboard. Select the publishing token you want to secure. Within the **Security** section you can edit the _Allowed origins_ to specify a list of domain names.

import DashboardAllowedOrigins from '../../assets/img/dashboard-allowed-origins.png';

<div class="center-container">
    <img src={DashboardAllowedOrigins} width="600" />
</div>

:::caution Restricting Viewers
By default, a [publish token](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/managing-your-tokens.md) does not restrict _viewers_ of the broadcast. If you want to also restrict viewers by origination, you must also setup [access control](/millicast/distribution/access-control/index.md) with the _secure viewer_ to require a subscribe token authorization to view the stream. There is a similar form value in the **Subscribe tokens** section of the dashboard.

## IP filters

Setting up an IP filter as a means of [access control](/millicast/distribution/access-control/index.md) may depend on whether or not you know the originating IP address ahead of time.

- If you have known _static_ IP addresses that do not change, you can identify specific _**allowed IP addresses**_.
- If the IP address is _unknown_ or _dynamic_ and might change between sessions, you can _**bind IP after usage**_ so that the IP address of any initial requests are accepted and the IP address is bound to the token. Any additional usage from that IP address will continue to be accepted but subsequent IP addresses would be rejected.

:::danger IP Filters with RTMP
This access control method is not supported when using RTMP.
:::

### Allowed IP addresses

This approach allows for explicitly defining multiple _IPv4 addresses_ or \_Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) \_notated network blocks when creating or updating a token. A token will only be accepted when the requesting IP address originates from one of the network addresses that match.

_For example_, to allow only a specific person or persons to broadcast you would specify the publisher's IP address in this property. If you wanted only a specific organization to be able to watch, you might specify the series of IP addresses in a subscribe token so that content can only be viewed within a specific network.

- a single IP address: `170.123.145.2`
- multiple IP addresses comma delimited: `170.123.145.2, 170.123.145.3`
- CIDR supernets: `192.168.6.0/24`

**Using IP address ranges and wildcards are not supported.**

Once IP addresses are set, only requests from that address or network will be permitted to broadcast or view a stream. If the user's network changes, they will be rejected for future connections. The Allowed IP addresses can be updated.

### Bind IP on usage

The bind IP on usage approach allows for explicitly defining how _many_ IP addresses to accept rather than specific ones. As they are gathered and bound to the token, any subsequent requests beyond the count will then be rejected.

You might think of this as appending any IP address requests to the _Allowed IP Address_ list only after they are dynamically determined.

_For example_, if you want to be able to share a stream with a specific end-user without allowing that person to re-share the same viewer link with others. The platform will bind to the first IP address encountered and then restrict any additional access using the same token.

### How-to set IP filters using the dashboard

You can manage IP filters by changing settings from the user interface of the [Streaming Dashboard](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/index.md).

:::tip Getting Started
If you haven't already, begin by following the [Getting Started](/millicast/introduction-to-streaming-apis.mdx) tutorial to create a Dolby.io application and start your first broadcast. You will need to have a publishing token. See [Managing Your Tokens](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/managing-your-tokens.md) for more details about tokens.
:::

Open the Live Broadcast section of the Dolby.io Dashboard. Select the publishing token you want to secure. Within the **Security** section you can change the _IP filter type_ from the dropdown.

import DashboardIpFilterType from '../../assets/img/dashboard-ip-filter-type.png';

<div class="center-container">
    <img src={DashboardIpFilterType} width="600" />
</div>

You then can input the IP addresses or number of addresses to bind, into the form.

:::caution Restricting Viewers
By default, a [publish token](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/managing-your-tokens.md) does not restrict _viewers_ of the broadcast. If you want to also restrict viewers by IP address, you must also setup [access control](/millicast/distribution/access-control/index.md) with the _secure viewer_ to require a subscribe token authorization to view the stream. There is a similar form value in the **Subscribe tokens** section of the dashboard.

## REST APIs

When working with allowed origins and IP filters you can automate workflows using available REST APIs.

- The [/api/publish_token](/millicast/api/publish-token-v-1-create-token.api.mdx) endpoint allows you to update the allowed origins or IP addresses for an existing publish token or to define a value when creating a new token
- The [/api/subscribe_token](/millicast/api/subscribe-token-v-1-create-token.api.mdx) endpoint allows you to update the allowed origins or IP addresses for an existing subscribe token or to define it while creating a new token

:::tip Using the REST APIs
Review the [REST API](/millicast/getting-started/using-rest-apis.md) platform guide for more details on generating an API secret for authentication. You will need an _API Secret_ from the dashboard in order to make requests.

### How-to add allowed origins with the REST API

For both the [/api/publish_token](/millicast/api/publish-token-v-1-create-token.api.mdx) and the [/api/subscribe_token](/millicast/api/subscribe-token-v-1-create-token.api.mdx) you can define the **allowedOrigins** parameter when you use a `POST` request to create a new token. For existing tokens, you'll use the `PUT` method to change the value using **updateAllowedOrigins**.

Here is an example of updating the Allowed Origins:

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [your_api_secret]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.millicast.com/api/subscribe_token/[token id] \
    -X PUT -d '{"updateAllowedOrigins": ["millicast.com","*.millicast.com"]}'
```

Review the [/api/publish_token](/millicast/api/publish-token-v-1-update-token.api.mdx) and [/api/subscribe_token](/millicast/api/subscribe-token-v-1-update-token.api.mdx) reference for additional examples.

### How-to add IP filters with the REST API

For both the [/api/publish_token](/millicast/api/publish-token-v-1-create-token.api.mdx) and the [/api/subscribe_token](/millicast/api/subscribe-token-v-1-create-token.api.mdx) you can define the **allowedIpAddresses** or **bindIpsOnUsage** parameters when you use a `POST` request to create a new token. For existing tokens, you'll use the `PUT` method to change the value using **updateAllowedIpAddresses** or **updateBindIpsOnUsage** values respectively.

Here is an example of updating the Allowed IP Addresses:

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [your_api_secret]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.millicast.com/api/subscribe_token/[token id] \
    -X PUT -d '{"updateAllowedIpAddresses": ["255.255.255.255"]}'
```

and to update the Bind IP on Usage:

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [your_api_secret]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.millicast.com/api/subscribe_token \
    -d '{"bindIpsOnUsage": 1}'
```

Review the [/api/publish_token](/millicast/api/publish-token-v-1-update-token.api.mdx) and [/api/subscribe_token](/millicast/api/subscribe-token-v-1-update-token.api.mdx) reference for additional examples.

### How-to remove IP filters

If you want to reset either a publish or subscribe token to no longer restrict access, you can use a bind value of zero and an empty array to clear out the settings and revert to the default.

```curl
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [your_api_secret]" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.millicast.com/api/subscribe_token/100 \
    -X PUT -d '{"bindIpsOnUsage": 0, "updateAllowedIpAddresses": []}'
```

Review the [/api/publish_token](/millicast/api/publish-token-v-1-update-token.api.mdx) and [/api/subscribe_token](/millicast/api/subscribe-token-v-1-update-token.api.mdx) reference for additional examples.

## Troubleshooting

### Error initializing the Publisher.Error: Unauthorized: IP Address not allowed

If the IP address detected does not match the IP Filters enabled, the user might be presented an error like this in the broadcast application.

import BroadcastError from '../../assets/img/broadcast-error.png';

<div class="center-container">
    <img src={BroadcastError} width="600" />
</div>

Verify that the IP address you are broadcasting from is static and correctly input for the publishing token being used.

### Error initializing the Publisher.Error: Unauthorized: Origin not allowed

If the domain detected does not match the allowed origins, the user might be presented with an error like this in the broadcast application.

import DashOriginBroadcastError from '../../assets/img/dashboard-origin-broadcast-error.png';

<div class="center-container">
    <img src={DashOriginBroadcastError} width="600" />
</div>

Verify that the domain your application is running from is included.
