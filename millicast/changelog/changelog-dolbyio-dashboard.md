# Dashboard Changes

Updates to the Dolby.io Dashboard and Applications.

## 2024-12-12 | Dashboard & Hosted Player

### Dashboard

On the dashboard, users can now set the account-wide expiration rules rules for their recorded media. This means that media can be auto-deleted without the need for additional API calls. This includes:

- [Recordings](/millicast/distribution/stream-recordings/index.mdx): The full-length stream recordings that are created when recording is enabled on a token
- [Clips](/millicast/distribution/stream-recordings/live-clipping.mdx): Clips generated from the [Media Asset API](/millicast/api/media-assets-create-media-asset/) when utilizing Dolby cloud storage
- [Timelines](/millicast/distribution/stream-recordings/live-clipping.mdx): Timelines are the "media cache" that clips are generated from and are required to create a clip. They are always stored on Dolby cloud storage. By default timelines will expire after 1 day. Users can change this value if they wish to be able to clip further back in time.

These settings are available in the streaming dashboard under `Settings > Media`

### Hosted Player

In the hosted player, we have hidden the view-timer by default. This is now able to be toggled on by adding a query parameter to the url (`&showTimer=true`) so that URLs would look like this to enable the timer: `https://viewer.millicast.com/?streamId=k9Mwad/multiview&showTimer=true`. As a reminder, the timer is how long the viewer has been watching the stream and not how long the stream has been running.

An image of what the timer looks like can be seen in the red circle below:

You can find additional related changes in the [REST APIs and GraphQL Release Notes](/millicast/changelog/changelog-rest-apis.md).

With **live clipping** you can capture a partial clip from an active ongoing stream that is immediately available.

Learn more from the [Stream Recordings](/millicast/distribution/stream-recordings/index.mdx) guide.

#### Media

The recordings menu has been replaced with a new **Media** section. This is where you can find any media being stored for your account. This view allows you to filter by type and all media is grouped by the token used to generate the media.
