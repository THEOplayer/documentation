## 2024-08-14 | Web SDK [0.2.1](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.2.1)

This release includes some minor updates:

- The **duration** in which a client has been connected is now returned with the `diagnose()` report. Additionally, the `on('stats')` data set has been updated so that **bitrate** is shown in bytes per second and a new value **bitrateBitsPerSecond** will return the bit value.  
  See [Client Analytics](/millicast/playback/client-analytics-and-monitoring.md) for additional details on how to retrieve and use these values.
- When working with [Frame Metadata](/millicast/playback/frame-metadata.md), the **uuid** parameter is now optional and allows for improved support from encoders that send **PIC_TIMING** metadata sources.

View the [0.2.1 release](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.2.1) tag for some additional details on these updates.

## 2024-07-17 | Web SDK [0.2.0](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

This release introduces some major improvements:

- With `sendMetadata()` you can publish metadata with your broadcast and synchronize playback events with frame-level accuracy.
- The `diagnose()` function can be used to troubleshoot the end-user quality of experience while gathering client-side analytics and key streaming metrics.
- The `forcePlayoutDelay` setting can be used when connecting to configure the buffer time the server will utilize for any lost frames that may occur under poor network conditions.
- You can enable [Simulcast](/millicast/using-webrtc-simulcast) (both viewing and publishing) on all chromium-based browsers including Edge.

### ðŸ†• Frame Metadata

A `metadata` event will be received with every frame as it is decoded for H.264 codecs that support **Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI)**. This allows for the exchange of arbitrary data between broadcast and playback clients or the extraction of **Action Message Format (AMF)** metadata from many common broadcast encoders.

```javascript
await millicastView.connect({ codec: 'h264', metadata: true });

millicastView.on('metadata', (metadata) => {
  if (metadata.timecode) {
    console.log('received timecode messsage', metadata.timecode);
  }
});
```

### ðŸ†• Client-side Diagnostics

To diagnose networking issues in your web applications it may be helpful to view [WebRTC statistics](/millicast/client-sdks/web/sdk/index.mdx#webrtc-stats) related to round-trip time, jitter, etc. This can also power [Client Analytics](/millicast/playback/client-analytics-and-monitoring.md) to populate application performance monitoring or observability tools such as [Datazoom](/millicast/datazoom) or [Datadog](/millicast/client-analytics/datadog.md). Using the new `statsIntervalMs`option you can customize the frequency in which the stats events are observed.

```javascript
const options = {
  peerConfig: {
    autoInitStats: true,
    statsIntervalMs: 5000,
  },
};

await millicastView.connect(options);

// This event will be fired every 5s instead of every 1s by default
millicastView.webRTCPeer.on('stats', (stats) => {
  console.log(stats);
});
```

With the `autoInitStats` setting it is no longer necessary to explicitly call `PeerConnection.initStats()`.

Introduced in 0.1.44, the`Logger.diagnose()` function has been extended and can be used to capture a historical snapshot of buffered stats events and application log history. Whenever seeking help to diagnose playback problems, the output of this function can be a valuable snapshot of an end-user problem report.

### ðŸ†’ Playback Buffer

Use the `forcePlayoutDelay` parameter as a connection option. This configures the buffer time the server will utilize which can correct for lost frames that may occur under poor network conditions. The values for **min** and **max** values (in milliseconds) allow for configuring a trade-off between latency and quality.

```javascript
const options = {
  forcePlayoutDelay: {
    min: 200,
    max: 250,
  },
};

await millicastView.connect(options);
```

### Other Updates

View the [0.2.0 release](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.2.0) tag for specific details on these updates.

- The `updated` [broadcast event](/millicast/playback/viewer-events.md) will now be available as a default event when connecting as an indication of cases where an audio track is added later and independent of the video feed.
- The 0.1.46 release included an `onMetadata` event that has been deprecated and replaced with `metadata` as the event type. Both events will continue to be emitted until version 0.3.0 and later.
- It is no longer necessary to specify a `streamName` to the constructor for **View** and **Publish** when provided to`Director.getSubscriber(streamName)`. It will continue to be accepted but will soon emit a deprecation warning and be removed entirely in the 1.0.0 release.
- The `updateBitrate()` function has been removed.

## 2024-03-11 | Web SDK [0.1.44](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.44)

View the [0.1.44 release](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.44) tag for the full list of changes.

### Features

Introduced a new `Logger.diagnose()` function to gather debugging information from playback clients. The data includes the SDK version, user agent, media stats, and application history into a format that can be helpful for reporting player problems. The number of data samples related to stream performance can be set with the `statsCount` parameter. See below for an example of the output from [diagnose](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/module-Logger.html#~diagnose):

```javascript
 {
  "version": "0.1.44",
  "timestamp": 1705005414689,
  "accountId": "...",
  "streamName": "demo",
  "subscriberId" "abc123",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
   "connection": "connected",
   "stats": [{
       "currentRoundTripTime": 0.045,
       "totalRoundTripTime": 5.175,
       "video": {
          "inbounds": [{
               "bitrate": 488504,
               "frameHeight": 720,
               "frameWidth": 1280,
               "framesPersecond": 30,
               "jitter": 0.002,
               "mimeType": "video/H264",
               ...
          }]},
       "audio": {...}
   }]
}
```

### Fixes

Added missed layer information in the `view` command. For [Simulcast](/millicast/using-webrtc-simulcast) broadcasts, some options specified during `view.connect()` for configuring the available `LayerInfo` were not being configured correctly. Learn more about the available [LayerInfo properties](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/global.html#LayerInfo).

## 2024-01-22 | Web SDK [0.1.43](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.43)

View the [0.1.43 release](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.43) tag for the full list of changes. You may also want to review the [Streaming Platform and Media Server Release Notes](changelog-dolbyio-platform-media-server.md) for details on the Geo-cascading, Backup Publishing, and Simulcast changes.

#### SDK Version

To improve traceability and reporting of issues, you can introspect the version of the SDK being used from `millicast.Logger.VERSION`.

```javascript
millicast.Logger.VERSION;
('0.1.43');
```

#### Broadcast Priority

To set up a broadcast that is resilient to failure (hardware, network, etc.) it is common to configure [Backup Publishing](/millicast/broadcast/redundant-ingest/index.mdx) where multiple sources are contributing to the same stream. The order in which the streams are started has been used to determine which stream is the primary and which one the backup. This can now be set explicitly with a `priority` value.

```javascript
try {
  await publisher.connect({ priority: 100 });
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Connection failed: ', e);
}
```

#### Safari Browser

Fix to better support Safari browser under slow network conditions and managing reconnection attempts.

#### Documentation

The SDK documentation has been simplified so that **Modules** and **Classes** are more clearly identified.

You can find a [class diagram](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk/blob/main/developer-info.md#sdk-components) in the repository that can be helpful to understand the relationships between classes and their properties.
