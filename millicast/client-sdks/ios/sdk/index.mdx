The Native SDK for creating iOS and tvOS applications. You may use it to connect, capture, publish, or subscribe to streams using the Dolby.io Streaming Platform.

:::caution Player vs SDK
Dolby OptiView offers a series of SDKs for most platforms to support your real-time streaming scenarios, however, we highly recommend that you leverage our [**Dolby OptiView Player**](../player/index.mdx) for playback.

The package name of the Native SDK for iOS is _millicast-native-sdk-\{version\}-XCFramework.zip_.

:::tip Note
If you want to use Streaming APIs on Android and iOS, you can also use the [Flutter SDK](/millicast/client-sdks/flutter/index.mdx) or the [React Native](/millicast/client-sdks/react-native/index.mdx) plugin.

## Requirements

- [Dolby.io account](https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup)
- A working video camera and microphone
- iOS [14.5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211808) or later
- Client SDK [1.8.0](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-native-sdk/releases) or later

## Adding the SDK to a project

To add the SDK to your project, you can either use Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods.

### Swift Package Manager

1. Go to your project settings in Xcode.
2. Go to the **Package Dependencies** tab and click on the **+** icon to add a new dependency.
3. In the line edit, enter the following package URL: https://github.com/millicast/millicast-sdk-swift-package. You should see the package appear.
4. Choose the version you want to use and click on **add package**.

### CocoaPods

1. Install CocoaPods if you have not already.
2. Open a terminal in the root of your XCode project.
3. Type `pod init` to create a `Podfile`.
4. Open the created file in a text editor and add the Millicast SDK as a dependency.

```ruby
target 'MyProject' do
  platform :ios, '14.5'
  # Comment the next line if you do not want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'MillicastSDK' '~> 2.0'
  # Pods for MyProject iOS
end
```

5. Type `pod install` in the terminal to install the SDK.

This step downloads and installs all needed dependencies and creates a `.xcworkspace` file. From now on, use this file instead of `.xcodeproj`.

6. You can update the SDK version in the podfile by running `pod update` in the terminal.
