Dolby.io Streaming APIs offer Client SDKs for customers who prefer creating their own applications. The SDKs can help you to connect, capture, publish, and view streams from the Streaming Platform. The platform offers the JavaScript SDK, React Native plugin, Flutter SDK, and Native SDK that supports creating Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, and Linux applications.

:::caution Player vs. SDK
Dolby OptiView offers a series of SDKs for most platforms to support your real-time streaming scenarios, however, we highly recommend that you leverage our **Dolby OptiView Player** for playback.
