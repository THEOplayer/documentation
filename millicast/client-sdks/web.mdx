The Web SDK lets you connect, capture, publish, and subscribe to streams in your web applications.

## Getting Started

import GettingStartedWebCallout from '../callouts/_getting_started_web.md';

<GettingStartedWebCallout />

### Installation

To use the SDK in your web applications you have options:

- include a hosted version from the [JSDELIVR CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@millicast/sdk) CDN
- add a dependency with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@millicast/sdk)

:::danger Versioning of the Millicast SDK
When installing and importing the SDK you may automatically be updated to the latest version. This is fine for development, but it is _strongly recommended_ to pin to a specific version release in order to increase stability when you move to production.
:::

#### JSDELIVR

You can include the SDK directly in your HTML by adding this element to the `<head>` of your page:

```html title="Import script"
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@millicast/sdk/dist/millicast.umd.min.js"></script>
```

If you want to pin or lock to a specific version, you can find available options from the [JSDELIVR @millicast/sdk](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@millicast/sdk) package releases.

#### NPM

You can install the package directly into your project with `npm`:

```shell title="bash"
npm i --save @millicast/sdk
```

If you want to pin or lock to a specific version, you can find available options from the [NPM @millicast/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@millicast/sdk) package releases.

### Check Browser Capabilities

Testing for browser compatibility is a quick test you can do to make sure the browser supports **video** and that you can reference the SDK.

```javascript title="NPM"
// Node Package Manager (NPM)
// You access SDK modules as an import from the @millicast/sdk package.

import { PeerConnection } from '@millicast/sdk';

const capabilities = PeerConnection.getCapabilities('video');
console.log(capabilities);
```

```javascript title="UMD"
// Universal Module Definition (UMD)
// You access SDK modules from the window.millicast namespace.

const capabilities = window.millicast.PeerConnection.getCapabilities('video');
console.log(capabilities);
```

```javascript title="ESM"
// ES Modules
// You access SDK modules through an import.

import { PeerConnection } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@millicast/sdk/dist/millicast.esm.js';

const capabilities = PeerConnection.getCapabilities('video');
console.log(capabilities);
```

You might also check and follow the [Web Platform Release Notes](/millicast/changelog/changelog-web-platform.md) page for updates and changes to the SDK.

## Basic Usage

The following examples require that you've already followed the [Getting Started](/millicast/getting-started/index.mdx) tutorial and have available your **publish token** and **stream name**.

### Publishing a Stream

The main module to publish a stream is the [Publish module](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html).

#### Instantiate the Publish module

To create a new publisher, you have to instantiate the Publish class:

```javascript
import { Director, Publish } from '@millicast/sdk';

const tokenGenerator = () =>
  Director.getPublisher({
    token: 'my-publishing-token',
    streamName: 'my-stream-name',
  });

const publisher = new Publish(undefined, tokenGenerator);
```

In order to create an instance of the `Publish` class, you have to send two parameters.

- The first one needs to be `undefined` as it has been deprecated.
- The second parameter is a callback (tokenGenerator) and it is used to get the necessary data of the stream name where you want to stream. Also, it is used to set auto reconnection if you are streaming and then lose connection. You have to set the stream name and the token of those.

More information here:

- [Publish](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html)
- [getPublisher()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/module-Director.html#~getPublisher)
- [Token generator callback](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/global.html#tokenGeneratorCallback)

#### Get your media information

You should get the media information (camera/microphone) you want to stream with. To do that, the SDK uses [MediaStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) object.

In this example, we are going to get the default user camera and microphone using the browser API [getUserMedia()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia):

```javascript
const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: true,
  video: true,
});
```

This will ask permission in the browser to get the camera and microphone and it will save the mediaStream information if the user accepts.

#### Initialize the stream

After all previous steps are completed, you can now initialize the stream using the `connect()` method inside the Publish module.

Using the instance of Publisher and mediaStream, add the connect method:

```javascript
// Publishing Options
const publishOptions = {
  mediaStream: mediaStream,
};

// Start publishing a stream
try {
  await publisher.connect(publishOptions);
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Connection failed, handle error', e);
}
```

Once the `connect()` promise resolves, the stream is initialized correctly, otherwise it'll throw an error.

The `connect()` can optionally receive more parameters, all of these are described in the [connect() method](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html#connect).

For example:

- If you want to start your stream with a bitrate limit, you can use the `bandwidth` option.
- If your stream token in Dolby.io Real-time Streaming has the recording enabled, you can enable it with the `record` option. Once you have finished your stream, you can see the recording in the [Dashboard Recordings section](/millicast/distribution/stream-recordings/index.mdx).
- You can start a stream without audio or video setting the `disableAudio` or `disableVideo` respectively.
- You can select which codec you want to stream using the `codec` option. If you want to know the supported codecs of your browser, you can use [getCapabilities()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/PeerConnection.html#.getCapabilities)

```javascript
import { PeerConnection } from '@millicast/sdk';

const capabilities = PeerConnection.getCapabilities('video');
console.log(capabilities);

// Output:
// [
//     {
//         "codec": "vp8",
//         "mimeType": "video/VP8",
//     },
//     {
//         "codec": "vp9",
//         "mimeType": "video/VP9",
//     },
//     {
//         "codec": "h264",
//         "mimeType": "video/H264"
//     },
//     {
//         "codec": "av1",
//         "mimeType": "video/AV1",
//     }
// ]
```

- [Dashboard Recordings section](/millicast/distribution/stream-recordings/index.mdx)
- [getCapabilities()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/PeerConnection.html#.getCapabilities)

#### Managing your active stream

The next samples use the `publisher` variable we created in the previous section.

The Publish instance internally uses most of the classes described in the [documentation](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/index.html).
If the method is not static (which means you can access it without a Publish instance), you can access it through the Publish instance.

Example:

```javascript
publisher.signaling; // Corresponds to the Signaling module.
publisher.webRTCPeer; // Corresponds to the Peerconnection module.
```

Most of the important methods are located directly in the Publisher module but some are not, like updating the bitrate or getting the WebRTC stats.

##### Change bitrate

During an active stream, you can limit the maximum bitrate in kbps.
To do that, you have to use the [updateBitrate()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/PeerConnection.html#updateBitrate) method of your Publish instance that is located inside a subclass called `webRTCPeer`.

Example:

```javascript
// Set the active stream with 2000 kbps limit.
await publisher.webRTCPeer.updateBitrate(2000);

// Set the active stream with no limit.
await publisher.webRTCPeer.updateBitrate(0);
```

##### Stop stream

If you want to stop an active stream, you can use the [stop()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html#stop) method of your Publish instance.

Example:

```javascript
publisher.stop();
```

### Viewing a Stream

The main module to view a stream is the [View module](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/View.html).

#### Instantiate the View module

Creating a new View instance:

```javascript
import { Director, View } from '@millicast/sdk';

// Create callback to generate a new token
const tokenGenerator = () =>
  Director.getSubscriber({
    streamName: 'publish-stream-name',
    streamAccountId: 'publish-account-id',
    // Optional: This token is needed if you're subscribing to a secure stream,
    // This token should be provided by the publish owner.
    subscriberToken: 'subscriber-token',
  });

const millicastView = new View(undefined, tokenGenerator);
```

Like when creating a `Publish` instance, in order to create a `View` instance you need two parameters and there are also two optional parameters.

- The first one needs to be `undefined` as it has been deprecated.
- The second parameter is a callback (tokenGenerator) and it is used to get the necessary data of the stream name where you want to connect. Also, it is used to set auto reconnection if you are streaming and then lose connection. You have to set the stream name and the token of those.
- \*\*(Optional) mediaElement. This is the HTML media element where you want to mount the stream for example a `video` element.
- \*\*(Optional) autoReconnect. The Default value is true, enabling auto reconnect to stream.

More information here:

- [View](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/View.html)
- [getSubscriber()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/module-Director.html#~getSubscriber)
- [Token generator callback](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/global.html#tokenGeneratorCallback)

#### Track event

In case the mediaElement parameter is not specified when creating a View instance a [track event](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/PeerConnection.html#event:track) will be emitted when the stream starts containing the media track.

```javascript
millicastView.on('track', (event) => {
  addStreamToYourVideoTag(event.streams[0]); // Manage the track event.
});
```

#### Connecting to a stream

After the previous steps are done then you can connect to the stream using the [connect()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/View.html#connect) method from the View instance.

```javascript
try {
  await millicastView.connect(options);
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Connection failed, handle error', e);
  await millicastView.reconnect();
}
```

We recommend using the [reconnect()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/View.html#reconnect) method in the `catch` clause to make sure the View instance keeps trying to reconnect until the stream is live even when an error in the connect occurs.

## Managing the Connection

### Reconnecting

Both the instances of Publish and View have a [reconnect](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/BaseWebRTC.html#event:reconnect) event. This event emits when the connection is lost with a timeout and error message in the callback. This event is emitted by the `reconnect()` method that both Publish and View instances have, this method is automatically called by default except specified with the `autoReconnect` flag of the [constructor](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/View.html).

Listen to the `reconnect` event from the `View` instance:

```javascript
import { View } from '@millicast/sdk';

const millicastView = new View(undefined, tokenGenerator);

millicastView.on('reconnect', ({ timeout, error }) => {
  console.log(timeout);
  console.error(error);
});
```

- The timeout is the time, in milliseconds, when is going to retry the connection. It starts at `2000 ms` and then `4000 ms` ... until `32000 ms` (`32 s`). After it goes to `32 s` then it keeps retrying in `32 s`.
- The error message contains the cause of failure.

More information here:

- [Publish reconnect](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html#reconnect)
- [View reconnect](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/View.html#reconnect)

### Broadcast events

In the connect method, you can send the events that you want to subscribe to, when the connection is done the SDK starts to emit an event called `broadcastEvents` to catch the data of each event:

```javascript
await millicastView.connect({
  events: ['active', 'inactive', 'stopped', 'vad', 'layers', 'migrate', 'viewercount'],
});
```

- `active`: Fires when the live stream is starting, or has started broadcasting.
- `inactive`: Fires when the stream has stopped broadcasting but is still available.
- `stopped`: Fires when the live stream has been disconnected and is no longer available.
- `vad`: Fires when the live stream is using multiplexed tracks for audio.
- `layers`: The live stream has to be broadcasting with simulcast. Fires when there is an update of the state of the layers in the live stream.
- `migrate`: Fires when the server is having problems, is shutting down or when viewers need to move for load balancing purposes.
- `viewercount`: Fires when the number of viewers changes in the stream published.

#### Managing online/offline status

The `broadcastEvents` can be used to detect when a stream is live or offline. There are two approaches to do this, it depends if you are contemplating multisource or not.

- If you are publishing without multisource, the `broadcastEvent` could be `active` which means that the stream is live. When it is `inactive` means that the stream is offline.

- If it is a multisource stream you have the same events but you are going to receive a source ID in the data payload. If you receive it as an `active` event, it means that a new source ID is available and the stream is active.
  To detect if the stream is `inactive`, you have to receive an inactive event and remove the incoming source ID from your active ones.
  If you don't have active source IDs, it means that the stream is offline.

More information here:

- [Broadcast event](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Signaling.html#event:broadcastEvent)
- [Multi-source broadcasting](/millicast/broadcast/multi-source-broadcasting.mdx)

Example of usage (contemplating both cases):

```javascript
const view = new View(streamName, tokenGenerator, video);

const activeSources = new Set();

view.on('broadcastEvent', (event) => {
  const { name, data } = event;
  switch (name) {
    // There is a new active source
    case 'active':
      activeSources.add(data.sourceId);
      console.log('Active Stream.');
      break;
    // A source became inactive
    case 'inactive':
      activeSources.delete(data.sourceId);
      if (activeSources.size === 0) {
        console.log('No active Stream.');
      }
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
});

try {
  await view.connect();
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Connection failed, handle error', e);
}
```

#### User count

Also with the `broadcastEvent` you can manage the number of active viewers in the stream. When receive the event with the name 'viewercount' in it you can get the updated viewercount info.

Example of usage:

```javascript
view.on('broadcastEvent', (event) => {
  const { name, data } = event;
  switch (name) {
    //...
    case 'viewercount':
      updateViewerCount(data.viewercount);
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Logger

You can get the logs of the connection, SDP, errors, and more. It can be enabled through the Logger module and you can activate it at any time (before/after a new connection).

```javascript
import { Logger } from '@millicast/sdk';

Logger.setLevel(Logger.DEBUG); // Set level visibility to DEBUG and prior
```

The Logger is always logging, even if the `setLevel()` is disabled.
You can access the latest logs history using the `.getHistory()` method.

```javascript
Logger.getHistory();

// Output
// [
//   "[Director] 2021-04-05T14:09:26.625Z - Getting publisher connection data for stream name:  1xxx2",
//   "[Director] 2021-04-05T14:09:27.064Z - Getting publisher response",
//   "[Publish]  2021-04-05T14:09:27.066Z - Broadcasting"
// ]
```

More information and examples here:

- [Logger](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/module-Logger.html)

### WebRTC stats

Stream stats can be accessed by both Publish and View instances. In order to capture them, you have to initialize the stats and then listen for the event through the `webRTCPeer` attribute.

:::caution Stats Variations
Keep in mind that the stats that are collected may differ from browser to browser, between browser versions, and may depend on the type of media that is being transferred.
:::

```javascript title="View"
import { View } from '@millicast/sdk';

// Initialize and connect your Viewer
const millicastView = new View(undefined, tokenGenerator);
await millicastView.connect();

// Capture new stats every 1s
millicastView.webRTCPeer.on('stats', (stats) => {
  console.log('Stats from event: ', stats);
});
```

```javascript title="Publish"
import { Publish } from '@millicast/sdk';

// Initialize and connect your Publisher
const millicastPublish = new Publish(undefined, tokenGenerator);
await millicastPublish.connect();

// Capture new stats every 1s
millicastPublish.webRTCPeer.on('stats', (stats) => {
  console.log('Stats from event: ', stats);
});
```

### How-to Disable Stats Collection

In earlier SDK versions, it was necessary to `initStats()` to enable this collection. This is now auto-initialized by default so will always be available. If you do not need stats you can disable this behavior.

```javascript
await millicastView.connect({
  autoInitStats: false,
});

// or alternatively stop them explicitly and remove listeners if unnecessary
millicastView.webRTCPeer.stopStats();
millicastView.webRTCPeer.removeAllListeners('stats');
```

### How-to Tune Latency and Quality

The `forcePlayoutDelay` setting can be used to adjust the buffer size used to in a connection to insure smooth playback. You can override the default settings and modify the values to better suit any known network conditions during playout.

```javascript
const connectionOptions = {
  forcePlayoutDelay: {
    min: 3000,
    max: 5000,
  },
};
```

## Tutorials

Additional tutorials for using specific features and capabilities.

### How-to Screenshare

You can enable screensharing from a browser as part of the broadcast. If you want to enable screen sharing and share your webcam at the same time, you must enable [multisource](/millicast/broadcast/multi-source-broadcasting.mdx) since you are broadcasting multiple streams. Alternately, you can share your screen using OBS.

For screen sharing browser support see [this article on Browser Compatibility for Media Devices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices#browser_compatibility).

To enable screensharing, first you must define `displayMediaOptions` and call the `getDisplayMedia` function. For more information, see [getDisplayMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia).

```javascript
const displayMediaOptions = {
  video: {
    displaySurface: 'window',
  },
  audio: false,
};

const screenCapture = await navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia(displayMediaOptions);
```

Set the `screenCapture` to the `mediaStream` object:

```javascript
const broadcastOptions = {
  mediaStream: screenCapture,
};
```

The following example creates a publisher object with the `token` and `streamName`. Then we connect using the publisher object and `broadcastOptions`.

```javascript
import { Director, Publish } from '@millicast/sdk';

const tokenGenerator = () =>
  Director.getPublisher({
    token: 'Publishing Token',
    streamName: 'Stream Name',
  });

const publisher = new Publish(undefined, tokenGenerator);

try {
  await publisher.connect(broadcastOptions);
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Connection failed, handle error', e);
}
```

### How-to Record a Stream

See the [Stream Recordings](/millicast/distribution/stream-recordings/index.mdx) guide for more details about this platform capability. You must use a [Publish Token](/millicast/streaming-dashboard/managing-your-tokens.mdx) that has recording enabled for the client to be able to activate recordings.

You can activate recording to begin shortly after connecting by providing the `record` option to [connect()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html#connect):

```javascript
const publishOptions = {
  record: true,
};

try {
  await publisher.connect(publishOptions);
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Connection failed, handle error', e);
}
```

You can call the [record()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html#record) function on-demand to activate it after the broadcast is already active:

```javascript
await publisher.record();
```

You can choose when to stop the recording using [unrecord()](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/Publish.html#unrecord) or wait until the session disconnects.

```javascript
await publisher.unrecord();
```
