title: Transcoder Hooks
---

The **transcoder** _type_ of [webhook](/millicast/webhooks/index.mdx) allows you to receive a state transition notification for platform events such as when a [transcoder](/millicast/distribution/cloud-transcoder.mdx) starts, stops, or is deleted.

:::tip Setting up Webhooks
Review the [Webhooks](/millicast/webhooks/index.mdx) guide for additional details on creating and receiving webhooks.

## Event

The `event` will be one of the following values:

- **ACTIVE** is sent when the transcoder transitions to an _Active_ status.
- **STOPPED** is sent when the transcoder transitions to a _Shutdown_ status.
- **DELETED** is sent when the transcoder transitions to a _Deleted_ status.

Review the [Cloud Transcoder](/millicast/distribution/cloud-transcoder.mdx) streaming guide for descriptions of the various transcoder statuses.

## Data

The `data` payload will contain the following details:

- **transcoderId** is a unique identifier of the transcoder.
- **transcoderName** is the label given to the transcoder.
- **cluster** is the [cluster region](/millicast/distribution/multi-region-support/index.mdx) where the transcoder is running.
- **createdOn** is the timestamp for when the transcoder was created.
- **status** is the state of the transcoder when the hook fired.
