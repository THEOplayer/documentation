When having a stream, it is possible to set up a loading screen before your event goes live. Having a stream-loading screen is a valuable asset as it serves as a polished introduction to the streaming experience, presenting a seamless and professional image to viewers. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, a **Stream preview ** maintains the audience's engagement during critical moments, as it can serve to provide a buffer for brief technical adjustments or seamless transitions between scenes.

## How to add a stream preview to your event

> 👍 Getting Started
>
> If you haven't already, begin by following the [Getting Started](/millicast/introduction-to-streaming-apis.mdx) tutorial to create a Dolby.io application and start your first broadcast. You'll need your _publish token_ and _stream name_ for the steps described below.

Open up the management screen of your stream token and visit the Playback tab. To the right on the _Hosted player path_, there will be a space for an **Offline image URL**. Here place the image's link with an HTTP-compliant URL.

Additionally, this feature can be accessed from inside the Broadcaster via the share icon. Under the Hosted Player iFrame URL, click on the Customize button, where a new window will show up with options to customize the player settings.

To ensure the image has been correctly added to the live stream, visit the Hosted player path URL, and you should see the image displayed as the stream is not live.
