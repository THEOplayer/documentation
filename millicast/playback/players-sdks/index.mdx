Dolby OptiView Streaming offers Client SDKs for customers who prefer creating their own applications. The SDKs can help you to connect, capture, publish, and view streams from the Streaming Platform. The platform offers the JavaScript SDK, React Native plugin, Flutter SDK, and Native SDK that supports creating Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, and Linux applications.

:::caution Player vs SDK
**Dolby OptiView Player** (formerly THEOplayer) now supports real-time streaming (formerly Millicast). Unless directed by your onboarding team, please use the Dolby OptiView player and not the Millicast SDKs.
