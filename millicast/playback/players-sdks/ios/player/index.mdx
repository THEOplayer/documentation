# Getting started with Millicast for iOS

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Usage

1. Follow our [Getting Started guide](pathname:///theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/getting-started) to set up THEOplayer in your iOS app.
2. Add the `THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast` dependency to your project.
3. Add the `THEOplayerMillicastIntegration` to the player.
4. Add a `MillicastSource` to your player's source.

### Add the `THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast` dependency

Add the Millicast integration as a dependency in to your project:

<Tabs queryString="lang">
    <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
    <TabItem value="spm" label="Swift Package Manager">
    ```swift
    .package(url: "https://github.com/THEOplayer/theoplayer-sdk-apple.git", from: "8.10.0")
    .product(name: "THEOplayerMillicastIntegration", package: "theoplayer-sdk-apple")
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cocoapods" label="Cocoapods">
    ```ruby
    pod 'THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast', '~> 8.10'
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
</Tabs>

### Add the Millicast integration to the player

First import the integration into your project:

```swift
import THEOplayerMillicastIntegration
```

Create and add the `THEOplayerMillicastIntegration` to your `THEOplayer`:

```swift
let millicastIntegration = MillicastIntegrationFactory.createIntegration()
theoplayer.addIntegration(millicastIntegration)
```

### Add a `MillicastSource`

After setting up a `THEOplayer` in your app, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `MillicastSource`.
You'll need a Millicast account ID and stream name to identify your Millicast stream:

```swift
let millicastSource = SourceDescription(source: MillicastSource(src: "multiview", streamAccountId: "k9Mwad"))
theoplayer.source = millicastSource
```

Here `src` refers to the stream name. Make sure to replace the above `src` and `streamAccountId` with your own. If your source is a secure stream, then you will
also need to add a subscriber token to the source as follows:

```swift
MillicastSource(src: ..., streamAccountId: ..., subscriberToken: "Your token")
```

### Add configuration

Optionally, you can provide additional configuration to the source, specific for working with Millicast streams.
To configure these settings, add a `MCClientOptions` object as the `connectOptions` parameter of the source object
and specify the options.

In the example below, the configuration is used to disable any audio from the Millicast stream.
For an exhaustive list of these options, visit the [documentation](https://millicast.github.io/doc/latest/apple/documentation/millicastsdk/mcclientoptions).

```swift
let connectOptions: MCClientOptions = .init()
connectOptions.disableAudio = true
MillicastSource(src: ..., streamAccountId: ..., connectOptions: connectOptions)
```

### Background playback

In order to play Millicast sources in the background, ensure you've configured a `backgroundPlaybackDelegate` on the player. A simple example for always allowing background playback is shown below:

```swift
class BackgroundDelegate: BackgroundPlaybackDelegate {
    func shouldContinueAudioPlaybackInBackground() -> Bool {
        return true
    }
}
theoplayer.backgroundPlaybackDelegate = BackgroundDelegate()
```
