# Diagnostics for Millicast on Web

For troubleshooting and analytics purposes, some statistics and diagnostics from Millicast are exposed on the player.

## WebRTC stats

Stream stats can be accessed from the Millicast `stats` event. To capture these events, add a listener on the Millicast API:

```javascript
player.millicast.addEventListener('stats', console.log);
```

It's possible to configure the frequency at which these events are dispatched through the Millicast source:

```javascript
player.source = {
  sources: {
    type: 'millicast',
    src: 'multiview',
    streamAccountId: 'k9Mwad',
    statsIntervalMs: 5000, // <= This property configures the stats interval in milliseconds
  },
};
```

## Millicast diagnostics

Diagnostics data can be accessed through the `diagnose` API on the player Millicast API. This method expects a diagnostics configuration as defined in [the Millicast SDK API reference](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/module-Logger.html#~diagnose), for example:

```javascript
console.log(
  player.millicast.diagnose({
    historySize: 10,
    minLogLevel: 'DEBUG',
    statsCount: 10,
    statsFormat: 'JSON',
  })
);
```
