The Native SDK for creating Android applications. You may use it in your Android project to connect, capture, publish, or subscribe to streams using the Dolby.io Streaming Platform.

:::caution Player vs SDK
**Dolby OptiView Player** (formerly THEOplayer) now supports real-time streaming (formerly Millicast). Unless directed by your onboarding team, please use the [Dolby OptiView Player](../player/index.mdx) and not the Millicast SDKs.
