**Osprey Video** is a world leader in broadcasting solutions and an early adopter of [WHIP](/millicast/broadcast/webrtc-whip.mdx) for their Osprey Talon 4K-SC Encoder. By supporting WHIP, Osprey is able to offer an encoder that can natively encode WebRTC streams at broadcast-level quality for a variety of applications, such as [sports broadcasting](https://dolby.io/solutions/sports-betting/), [live event broadcasting](https://dolby.io/solutions/live-events/), and [auction streaming](https://dolby.io/solutions/auctions/).

You can originate a broadcast from Osprey over a [WHIP](/millicast/broadcast/webrtc-whip.mdx), [SRT](/millicast/broadcast/using-srt.mdx) or [RTMP](/millicast/broadcast/using-rtmp-and-rtmps.mdx) source.

:::tip Getting Started
If you haven't already, begin by following the [Getting Started](/millicast/getting-started/index.mdx) tutorial to start your first broadcast. You'll need your _RTMP publish path_ and _RTMP publish stream name_ for the steps described below.

See the official [Osprey Video](https://www.ospreyvideo.com/) site for documentation, installation instructions, and additional support.

## Osprey Talon

For cameras that donâ€™t have built-in encoders, you can connect the camera to an external encoder such as the Osprey Talon.

import OspreyTalon from '../assets/img/b12e768-Osprey_Talon.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={OspreyTalon} width="600" />
</div>

You'll need to plug an ethernet connection and a power supply into your Talon encoder and power the device on.

import OspreyTalon2 from '../assets/img/Image-6-2.jpg';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={OspreyTalon2} width="600" />
</div>

Once powered on, the device will be discoverable on your local network. You can interface with the device by opening the IP address in your browser, or, if you are a Windows user, you can [download the Osprey Boss Pro](https://www.ospreyvideo.com/talon-software-and-firmware), which provides a UI for finding the encoder.

Once found in your browser, you'll be prompted to log into the device. Refer to the [Osprey Talon Encoder User Manual ](https://www.ospreyvideo.com/manuals)to learn about your device's username and password.

import OspreyTalon3 from '../assets/img/2B9A2FCC-5901-4390-A7A2-4682899CBD78_1_201_a.jpeg';

<div class="center-container">

### How-to use Osprey Talon with WHIP

To get started, you'll have to [login](https://streaming.dolby.io) to a Dolby.io account. Within the account, you'll need the _Stream Name_ and _Publishing Token_.

Inside the encoder UI, click on the _Channels_ tab. From the Channels tab, set the protocol to Dolby.io (WebRTC). Enter your Stream Name and Publishing Token in the corresponding fields.

import WhipOsprey from '../assets/img/whip-osprey-talon.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={WhipOsprey} width="600" />
</div>

After inputting your credentials, switch to the Dashboard tab and click the green button to start the broadcast.

import OspreyBroadcast from '../assets/img/aa7dff6-osprey-broadcast.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={OspreyBroadcast} width="600" />
</div>

The stream is now live. To view the stream, navigate back to your newly created token on the Dolby.io Dashboard and switch to the _Playback_ tab. From the Playback tab, copy the _Hosted Player Path_ URL and open it in your browser.

### How-to use Osprey Talon with SRT

To get started, you'll have to [login](https://streaming.dolby.io) to a Dolby.io account. Within the account, you'll need the _SRT stream ID_ and _SRT publish path_.

Inside the encoder UI, click on the _Channels_ tab. From the Channels tab, set the protocol to **TS over SRT**.

- For the `SRT Dest Address` input the **SRT publish path** with the port kept separate in the `SRT Port`.
- The value of the `SRT Stream ID` must be URL encoded. To get that URL encoded value, look for the **SRT publish URL** and copy the string of characters after `_?streamId=_`. For example, "_lq11zkzu%3Ft%3DVgkvUAa5b3QvoLW5b3QvoLW5b3QvoLW-ak_".

import OspreySrt from '../assets/img/osprey-srt.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={OspreySrt} width="600" />
</div>

Once configured, you can press start and the encoder will begin streaming content.

#### Turn on SRT encryption

To enable SRT encryption for the SRT feed, in the Dolby.io dashboard for your stream token, enable **Passphrase encryption** and copy the **SRT passphrase**.

import StrPassphrase from '../assets/img/srt-passphrase.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={StrPassphrase} width="600" />
</div>

In the Osprey Talon dashboard, enable AES-128 Encryption and paste the passphrase.

import StrEncryption from '../assets/img/osprey-srt-encryption.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={StrEncryption} width="600" />
</div>

Once configured, you can press start and the encoder will begin streaming content.

### How-to use Osprey Talon with RTMP

To get started, you'll have to [login](https://streaming.dolby.io) to a Dolby.io account. Within the account, you'll need the _RTMP publish path_ and _RTMP publish stream name_.

Inside the encoder UI, click on the _Channels_ tab. From the Channels tab, set the protocol to **RTMP/RTMPS**.

- For the `Destination` input the **RTMP publish path**.
- For the `Stream Key` input the **RTMP publish stream name**.

import OspreyRtmp from '../assets/img/osprey-rtmp-millicast.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={OspreyRtmp} width="600" />
</div>

Once configured, you can press start and the encoder will begin streaming content.
