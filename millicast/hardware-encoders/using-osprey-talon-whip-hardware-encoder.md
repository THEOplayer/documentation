**Osprey Video** is a world leader in broadcasting solutions and an early adopter of [WHIP](/millicast/broadcast/webrtc-whip.mdx) for their Osprey Talon 4K-SC Encoder. By supporting WHIP, Osprey is able to offer an encoder that can natively encode WebRTC streams at broadcast-level quality for a variety of applications, such as [sports broadcasting](https://dolby.io/solutions/sports-betting/), [live event broadcasting](https://dolby.io/solutions/live-events/), and [auction streaming](https://dolby.io/solutions/auctions/).

You can originate a broadcast from Osprey over a [WHIP](/millicast/broadcast/webrtc-whip.mdx) or [SRT](/millicast/broadcast/using-srt.mdx) source.

- [Configure SRT](/millicast/using-osprey-talon-whip-hardware-encoder#how-to-use-osprey-talon-with-srt)

> 👍 Getting Started
>
> If you haven't already, begin by following the [Getting Started](/millicast/getting-started/index.mdx) tutorial to start your first broadcast. You'll need your _publish token_ and _stream name_ for the steps described below.

See the official [Osprey Video](https://www.ospreyvideo.com/) site for documentation, installation instructions, and additional support.

## Osprey Talon

For cameras that don’t have built-in encoders, you can connect the camera to an external encoder such as the Osprey Talon.

You'll need to plug an ethernet connection and a power supply into your Talon encoder and power the device on.

Once powered on, the device will be discoverable on your local network. You can interface with the device by opening the IP address in your browser, or, if you are a Windows user, you can [download the Osprey Boss Pro](https://www.ospreyvideo.com/talon-software-and-firmware), which provides a UI for finding the encoder.

Once found in your browser, you'll be prompted to log into the device. Refer to the [Osprey Talon Encoder User Manual ](https://www.ospreyvideo.com/manuals)to learn about your device's username and password.

### How-to use Osprey Talon with WHIP

To get started, you'll have to [login](https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup) to a Dolby.io account. Within the account, you'll need the _Stream Name_ and _Publishing Token_.

Inside the encoder UI, click on the _Channels_ tab. From the Channels tab, set the protocol to Dolby.io (WebRTC). Enter your Stream Name and Publishing Token in the corresponding fields.

After inputting your credentials, switch to the Dashboard tab and click the green button to start the broadcast.

The stream is now live. To view the stream, navigate back to your newly created token on the Dolby.io Dashboard and switch to the _Playback_ tab. From the Playback tab, copy the _Hosted Player Path_ URL and open it in your browser.

### How-to use Osprey Talon with SRT

To get started, you'll have to [login](https://dashboard.dolby.io/signup) to a Dolby.io account. Within the account, you'll need the _SRT stream ID_ and _SRT publish path_.

Inside the encoder UI, click on the _Channels_ tab. From the Channels tab, set the protocol to **TS over SRT**.

- For the `SRT Dest Address` input the **SRT publish path** with the port kept separate in the `SRT Port`.
- The value of the `SRT Stream ID` must be URL encoded. To get that URL encoded value, look for the **SRT publish URL** and copy the string of characters after `_?streamId=_`. For example, "_lq11zkzu%3Ft%3DVgkvUAa5b3QvoLW5b3QvoLW5b3QvoLW-ak_".

Once configured, you can press start and the encoder will begin streaming content.

#### Turn on SRT encryption

To enable SRT encryption for the SRT feed, in the Dolby.io dashboard for your stream token, enable **Passphrase encryption** and copy the **SRT passphrase**.

In the Osprey Talon dashboard, enable AES-128 Encryption and paste the passphrase.

Once configured, you can press start and the encoder will begin streaming content.
