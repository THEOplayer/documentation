## Using the Ultra Encode to broadcast RTMP

The [Magewell Ultra Encode](https://www.magewell.com/ultra-encode) supports broadcasting RTMP streams, which can be ingested by the Dolby.io Real-time Streaming service.

To begin, first power on your Ultra Encode, connect it to the internet (Ethernet or WiFi), and connect your video capture device. Once connected, [log in](https://www.magewell.com/files/documents/User_Manual/ultra_encode_user_manual_en.pdf) to the Ultra Encode dashboard and navigate to the `Streaming Server` tab on the left side panel. Inside of `Streaming Server` click the `+ Add Server` button and select `RTMP`.

Next, navigate to your [Dolby.io Dashboard](https://dashboard.dolby.io/signin) and [gather your RTMP token credentials](/millicast/broadcast/using-rtmp-and-rtmps.mdx#how-to-find-your-rtmp-publish-url). Add the `RTMP publish path` from your Dolby.io Dashboard to the `URL`, and add your `RTMP Publish Stream Name`, also from the Dolby.io dashboard, to the `Stream key`.

Finally, select which network you'd like the encoder to use to connect, and save the settings.
