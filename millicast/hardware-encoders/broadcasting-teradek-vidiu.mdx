## Teradek

### How-to setup the VidiU for RTMP streaming

To get started, you'll have to [login](https://streaming.dolby.io) to a Dolby.io account. Within the account, you'll need to create a token and copy RTMP publishing paths. You'll also have to download the [Vidiu or Teradek app](https://teradek.com/pages/vidiu-x) for your mobile device.

From your VidiU app on your mobile device, select `Device > Settings > Broadcast > Platform`. After Platform, select `RTMP(S)` at the bottom of the menu.

import Vidiu1 from '../assets/img/0a7f149-vidiu1.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={Vidiu1} width="400" />
</div>

Select "Setup new Destination".

import Vidiu2 from '../assets/img/094b7e2-vidiu2.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={Vidiu2} width="400" />
</div>

Enter your Dolby.io Real-time Streaming RTMP or RTMPS path, and your RTMP publish stream name:

- For example, RTMP would look similar to:  
  `rtmp://rtmp-auto.millicast.com:1935/v2/pub`
- For example, RTMPS would look similar to:  
  `rtmps://rtmp-auto.millicast.com:443/v2/pub`
- For example, StreamName would look similar to:  
  `myStreamName?token=3bc330607a15a0ecebebd8c9ee2a559fd143c937174bd276e213a96425bb107e`

import Vidiu3 from '../assets/img/5fab6f1-vidiu3.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={Vidiu3} width="400" />
</div>

With the credentials added, you're ready to start your broadcast. The stream can be started from the app or via the "broadcast" button on the physical Vidiu encoder.

To view the stream, navigate back to your newly created token and switch to the "Playback" tab. From the "Playback" tab, copy the "Hosted Player path" URL and open it in your browser as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRLIT_Xii3M).

### How-to setup the Teradek Wave for RTMP streaming

To get started, you'll have to [login](https://streaming.dolby.io) to a Dolby.io account. Within the account, you'll need to create a token and copy RTMP publishing paths. You'll also have to have your Teradek Wave in hand, ready to use.

- From your Teradek Wave, start by selecting `Create event > Device > Configure your event`and setting your Channel Name.
- Set the Server URL for RTMP as your RTMP publish path. For example:  
  `rtmp://rtmp-auto.millicast.com:1935/v2/pub`  
  _OR_
- Set the Server URL for RTMPS as your RTMPS publish path. For example:  
  `rtmps://rtmp-auto.millicast.com:443/v2/pub`
- Set the StreamName as your RTMP publish stream name. For example:  
  `myStreamName?token=3bc330607a15a0ecebebd8c9ee2a559fd143c937174bd276e213a96425bb107e`

import TeradekWave from '../assets/img/18e114a-Teradek_wave.jpg';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={TeradekWave} width="600" />
</div>

You can also adjust the additional settings on the Teredak Wave, such as:

- Recording Settings
- Video Settings
- Audio Settings

To view the stream, navigate back to your newly created token and switch to the _Playback_ tab. From the Playback tab, copy the _Hosted Player Path_ URL and open it in your browser.

Teredak products that use [RTMP, RTMPS](/millicast/broadcast/using-rtmp-and-rtmps.mdx), [SRT](/millicast/broadcast/using-srt.mdx), and [NDI](/millicast/broadcast/using-ndi.md) can all be used with Dolby.io Real-time Streaming for low-latency streams with global delivery.
