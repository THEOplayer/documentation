## Additional 360 camera live-streaming options

This set up be will using a Ricoh Theta 360 camera with a USB connection. It can also be used with any 360 camera that supports camera capture with via USB, NDI or HDMI output.

The built in Dolby.io Broadcaster can be used or you can also use a 360 video with OBS if no 360 camera is available.
