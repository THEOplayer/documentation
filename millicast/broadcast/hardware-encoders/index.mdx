import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

In today's digital landscape, the demand for real-time streaming content has skyrocketed, prompting broadcasters and video creators to prioritize the efficient delivery of high-quality video and audio streams. Hardware-based encoders play a crucial role in this process with their offerings of superior encoding capabilities and seamless transmission. Needless to say, workflows don't have to be interrupted in order to better a stream. Using the Dolby.io Streaming API protocols like [SRT](/millicast/broadcast/srt.mdx), [NDI](/millicast/broadcast/ndi.md), and [WHIP](/millicast/broadcast/webrtc-and-whip.mdx) can be ingested directly from the encoders like [Teradek](teradek.mdx), [Osprey](osprey.mdx), and [Videon](videon.mdx) and distributed in WebRTC.
