[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is a video collaboration tool for hosting conferences and meetings. Zoom supports streaming to consumer platforms or any [RTMP](/millicast/broadcast/rtmp-and-rtmps.mdx) source such as distributing Real-time Streaming content with Dolby.io.

See the official [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) site for documentation, installation instructions, and additional support.

## Get your Dolby.io RTMP publish URL

In order to broadcast with RTMP, you will need to have your **RTMP publish path** and **RTMP publish stream name** available.

See the [RTMP Broadcast Guide](/millicast/broadcast/rtmp-and-rtmps.mdx#how-to-find-your-rtmp-publish-url) for details on how to retrieve these values.

## How-to stream a Zoom meeting or webinar with RTMP

First, you must need a Zoom paid account in order to ingest your Zoom meetings into Dolby.io Real-time Streaming via RTMP so you can broadcast it massively in almost real-time.

- Note: The account needs to be either a Pro, Business, Education, or Enterprise plan.

To enable all members of your organization to have access to live-streaming meetings

### 1. Start a webinar

Start the webinar as usual by doing one of the following:

- From your calendar — if you have added the webinar to your calendar, click the link displayed on your calendar reminder.
- From the Zoom website — sign into Zoom, find the webinar in the My Webinars tab and click Start.

### 2. View more settings

Click the **More** button on your control panel to view available options.
