# Enhanced Broadcasting in OBS

Enhanced Broadcasting in OBS enables multitrack video support creating multiple "renditions" or qualities that OBS sends to Millicast so that the end-viewer can choose which quality to watch or let it happen automatically. This is called Adaptive Bitrate (ABR).

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={AbrImg} width="600" />
</div>

To use this feature, _you will need OBS version `31.1` at a minimum_. Then, after choosing "Dolby Millicast" from the `Stream > Service`, enable _Enhanced Broadcasting_.

## Automatic Stream Configuration

Understanding complicated video settings to achieve the highest video quality can be time consuming and frustrating and challenging if you are instructing remote streamers. By selecting "☑️ Auto", OBS sends information about your setup to Dolby Millicast and the service tells OBS how to configure itself. Automatic stream configuration removes the need for offline trial and error to find the correct settings. A server-side algorithm then returns the best possible configuration for broadcast software that optimizes the viewer experience given constraints in your setup.

### Custom Layer Count

import ObsMultiTrackVideoManualLayers from '../../../assets/img/obs-millicast-ertmp-manual-layers.jpg';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={ObsMultiTrackVideoManualLayers} width="600" />
</div>

A user can uncheck the _Auto_ box and choose the number of ABR tracks to send. Based on the resolution, bitrate, and number of layers requested, the streaming service will configure the ladder.

## Minimum System Requirements

While we work to increase support for other systems, these are the minimum requirements:

- **GPU and Driver Version**
  - NVIDIA GeForce 900-series or newer with NVIDIA driver version `31.0.15.4500` or newer
  - Apple M1 and newer GPUs
  - _Experimental_: Intel GPUs
- **Operating System**
  - Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Broadcast Software**
  - OBS Studio version `31.1` (or newer)
- **Network**
  - We recommend a minimum sustained upload bandwidth availability of 12 mbps and a contribution bitrate between 6000 and 2000 Kbps depending on the number of layers, content, and use-case
