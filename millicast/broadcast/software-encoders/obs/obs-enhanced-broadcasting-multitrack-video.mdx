# Enhanced Broadcasting in OBS

Enhanced Broadcasting in OBS enables multitrack video support creating multiple "renditions" or qualities that OBS sends to Dolby OptiView Real-time so that the end-viewer can choose which quality to watch or let it happen automatically. This is called Adaptive Bitrate (ABR).

</div>

To use this feature, _you will need OBS version `31.1` at a minimum_. Then, after choosing `Dolby OptiView Real-time` (`Dolby Millicast` in OBS version older than 32.0.2) from the `Stream > Service`, enable _Enhanced Broadcasting_.

## Automatic Stream Configuration

Understanding complicated video settings to achieve the highest video quality can be time consuming and frustrating and challenging if you are instructing remote streamers. By selecting "☑️ Auto", OBS sends information about your setup to Dolby OptiView Real-time and the service tells OBS how to configure itself. Automatic stream configuration removes the need for offline trial and error to find the correct settings. A server-side algorithm then returns the best possible configuration for broadcast software that optimizes the viewer experience given constraints in your setup.

### Custom Layer Count

</div>

A user can uncheck the _Auto_ box and choose the number of ABR tracks to send. Based on the resolution, bitrate, and number of layers requested, the streaming service will configure the ladder.

## Minimum System Requirements

While we work to increase support for other systems, these are the minimum requirements:

- **GPU and Driver Version**
  - NVIDIA GeForce 900-series or newer with NVIDIA driver version `31.0.15.4500` or newer
  - Apple M1 and newer GPUs
  - _Experimental_: Intel GPUs
- **Operating System**
  - Windows 10 or Windows 11
- **Broadcast Software**
  - OBS Studio version `31.1` (or newer)
- **Network**
  - We recommend a minimum sustained upload bandwidth availability of 12 mbps and a contribution bitrate between 6000 and 2000 Kbps depending on the number of layers, content, and use-case
