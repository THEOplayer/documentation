This repository demonstrates how to develop a real-time streaming viewer or monitoring app using Dolby.io's Real-time Streaming solution which features ultra low-latency (sub 500ms).

The application provided can be used as it is or with your own modifications to create or embed a real-time streaming viewer on iOS/TvOS app. You can clone the repository yourself, run the application locally or customize it to make it your own. Learn more about Dolby.io’s Real-time Streaming capabilities [here](https://dolby.io/products/real-time-streaming/).

You can start monitoring a stream with the stream name and account ID, which you can create and start streaming from the [Dolby.io dashboard](https://dashboard.dolby.io/).

If you run into problems, the full Dolby.io Real-time Streaming SDK for iOS documentation can be found [here](/millicast/client-sdks/ios/index.mdx).

Supported features:

- Native viewer for iOS, iPad OS, and tvOS devices
- Ability to remember previously viewed streams
- Simulcast support
