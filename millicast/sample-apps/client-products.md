Millicast Studio allows you to capture and publish to the Millicast Platform, as well as view the published stream via an attached loopback display. The Studio accepts inputs from devices (e.g. camera), screens, NDI and Blackmagic Decklink cards' SDI and HDMI, and comes with command line interface as well as graphical user interface.

Millicast Player allows you to view streams published to the Millicast Platform. The player has an attached display, as well as the ability to output via NDI, and Blackmagic Decklink cards' SDI and HDMI.

WebRTC stats are also available on Studio and Player. Studio and Player apps can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-native-sdk/releases). More details can be found on this [readme](https://github.com/millicast/millicast-native-sdk/blob/main/README.md).
