This part explains how to get started using just the Dolby.io Streaming Dashboard to both broadcast and playback a real-time stream without writing any code.

This tutorial is split into two sections:

- [Broadcast from the Dashboard](#capture-and-broadcast-from-the-dashboard)
- [Playback with the Streaming Viewer](#playback-content-with-the-streaming-viewer)

## Capture and broadcast from the dashboard

We will begin by [broadcasting](/millicast/broadcast/index.mdx) directly from the Dolby.io Streaming Dashboard, [capturing](/millicast/capture/index.mdx) audio and video with a web camera.

### a. Create a publish token

When you log into your Dolby.io account you should select the **Streaming** tab. If you haven't used your account before, you'll see a screen similar to Figure 1a below.

import DashboardTokensEmpty from '../assets/img/dashboard-tokens-empty.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={DashboardTokensEmpty} width="500" />
</div>

Click the `+ CREATE` button and you'll be prompted to configure a new token. The token is used to authenticate an application for publishing a live stream from your account.

import AddNewTokenPopup from '../assets/img/dolbyio-streaming-add-new-token-popup.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={AddNewTokenPopup} width="300" />
</div>

Give this token a meaningful label such as _gettingStarted_ and click the `CONFIRM` button. You can have more than one stream using the same token, so each can be labeled independently such as this one having the default _myStreamName_.

### b. Start broadcast

Return to the _Live broadcast_ section and click the `BROADCAST` button.

import BroadcastButton from '../assets/img/dolbyio-streaming-broadcast-button.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={BroadcastButton} width="600" />
</div>

From the dashboard broadcast application that opens, click the green `Start` button to begin a broadcast. You will need to give permission to access your microphone and camera. Once the stream begins, you can see the _LIVE_ box in the upper right corner and a timecode for the duration of the stream above the `Stop` button.

</div>

## Playback content with the streaming viewer

In the previous section, you created a publishing token and started to broadcast. Next, we will open a hosted streaming viewer to [playback](/millicast/playback/index.mdx) the real-time stream.

In the lower right-hand corner of the dashboard broadcast application are some icons. Click on the sharing icon like the one circled in Figure 2a.

import BroadcastIcon from '../assets/img/dolbyio-share-broadcast-icon.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={BroadcastIcon} width="200" />
</div>

Click the `LAUNCH` button to open the hosted live viewer.

import BroadcastLaunch from '../assets/img/dolbyio-share-broadcast-launch.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={BroadcastLaunch} width="500" />
</div>

It may seem like you are watching a local mirror of your video camera, but this feed is making a full round-trip to the servers and back to the browser again. Note the low delay between capture from the webcam and playback within the browser.

import PlaybackViewer from '../assets/img/dolbyio-streaming-dashboard-playback-viewer.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={PlaybackViewer} width="500" />
</div>

The viewer has some user controls to pause the stream, configure settings, and view the number of other stream viewers.

## Continue learning

In this tutorial, we were able to start and view a real-time stream. To continue with your project, you may want to customize the experience. The next part will help with getting started to build [a custom web application](/millicast/getting-started/creating-real-time-streaming-web-app.mdx).
