# Getting started with Millicast

**Dolby.io Real-time Streaming APIs** make it easier to globally stream your high-value content with broadcast-quality color and sound to massive audiences all with sub 500ms latency. Use this tutorial to quickly set up and run your own private stream and begin building applications for a variety of use cases such as remote production, sports, gaming & betting, live events, etc.

:::tip[Dolby.io Account]
Sign in into your [Dolby.io account](https://streaming.dolby.io) to access the Streaming Dashboard.
:::

For an introduction to the platform overall, start with the [Introduction to Streaming APIs](/millicast/introduction-to-streaming-apis.mdx).

## Part 1: Use the Streaming Dashboard

Begin by broadcasting directly [using the Dolby.io Streaming Dashboard](/millicast/getting-started/using-the-dashboard.mdx).

- Create a Publish token
- Broadcast a stream with the Streaming Dashboard
- Playback the stream using the hosted Viewer App

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: 'link',
    href: '/millicast/getting-started/using-the-dashboard',
    docId: 'getting-started/using-the-dashboard',
    customProps: {
      icon: '➡️',
    },
    label: 'Start with Part 1',
  }}
/>

## Part 2: Create a Streaming Web Application

After completing Part 1, you can now progress onto Part 2, building a custom web application using the [Streaming Web SDK](/millicast/playback/players-sdks/web/sdk/index.mdx) to playback and view a stream or start a new broadcast.

- Create a web application to playback a stream
- Create a web application to broadcast a stream

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: 'link',
    href: '/millicast/getting-started/creating-real-time-streaming-web-app',
    docId: 'getting-started/creating-real-time-streaming-web-app',
    customProps: {
      icon: '➡️',
    },
    label: 'Jump to Part 2',
  }}
/>

## Part 3: Automating Workflows Using REST APIs

After learning how to stream with the dashboard or by building a web application in parts 1 and 2, you can move on to building your production workflows. Using the REST APIs you can automate creating and managing tokens.

- Get an API Token
- Call the `/api/publish_token` REST endpoint to create tokens

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: 'link',
    href: '/millicast/getting-started/using-rest-apis',
    docId: 'getting-started/using-rest-apis',
    customProps: {
      icon: '➡️',
    },
    label: 'Jump to Part 3',
  }}
/>

## Part 4: Create Mobile Streaming Apps

To reach larger audiences you may want to consider integrating streaming into your mobile applications.

- Create Native iOS (Swift) and/or Android (Kotlin)
- Create Native Builds for other devices (C++)

<DocCard
  item={{
    type: 'link',
    href: '/millicast/getting-started/mobile-apps',
    docId: 'getting-started/mobile-apps',
    customProps: {
      icon: '➡️',
    },
    label: 'Jump to Part 4',
  }}
/>
