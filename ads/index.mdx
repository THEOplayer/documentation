# Dolby OptiView Ads Introduction

import SidebarDocCardList from '@site/src/components/SidebarDocCardList';

OptiView Ads is an ad insertion service for LIVE content (VoD support coming soon), utilizing Server-Guided Ad Insertion (SGAI). On these pages, you'll learn how to get started with OptiView Ads, how to configure the player and integrate the signaling service APIs.

By logically redistributing responsibilities in the advertisement workflow, OptiView Ads:

- Creates a seamless viewer experience across platforms.
- Simplifies the workflow by reducing complexity, which results in easier implementation and lower operational risk.
- Introduces innovative ad formats, creating more diverse and less intrusive ad opportunities.
- Maximizes workflow efficiency by reducing prefetching and over-allocation of inventory.
- Enables more relevant ads through a high degree of personalization.

OptiView Ads is an advanced ad insertion service consisting of two key components:

1. **Signaling Service**: This back-end component enriches the manifest from your existing origin with advanced ad break signaling. It integrates seamlessly with OptiView Player, the second component, to create a smooth and cohesive workflow.

2. **OptiView Player**: The player fetches and replaces ads within the content, working closely with the Signaling Service to optimize the viewer experience across platforms.

The Signaling Service is provided as a service and can be integrated into any existing content management workflow through its APIs, allowing for seamless adoption without significant changes to your current setup.

To ensure high availability, we recommend maintaining the original origin stream on a CDN as a backup, while the Signaling Service provides redundancy and failover capabilities to further enhance reliability.

OptiView Ads is tightly integrated with [Google Ad Manager](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/dynamic-ad-insertion 'Google DAI') for ad decisioning, transcoding, and serving, ensuring a streamlined process for ad delivery and management.

OptiView Ads enables innovative ad formats through THEOplayer, providing new ways to monetize content in a less intrusive manner. The out-of-the-box formats include, but are not limited to:

- **Default Full Screen Ad Insertion**: Replaces the content with an advertisement.
- **Double Box**: Allows content to continue playing side-by-side with an advertisement and its companion background.
- **L-Shape**: Displays content or advertisements in a scaled window alongside a companion background.

**Note**: Every OptiView Player comes with the functionality to enable OptiView Ads by default. However, a OptiView ads-enabled OptiView Player license is required to activate this functionality.
