# Getting started with OptiView Ads on iOS

This guide will get you started to integrate OptiView Ads in your THEOplayer iOS SDK: configure the license, update dependencies and set the source description.

## Prerequisites

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

1.  You need to have a THEOplayer license which is compatible with OptiView Ads. This can be done through the [player portal](https://portal.theoplayer.com).
2.  You need a working [OptiView Ads signaling service](signaling-service.mdx).
3.  Add the THEOplayer iOS SDK to your project by following our [Getting started](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/getting-started) guide. Make sure to [set up a OptiView Ads-compatible license](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/getting-started/#theoplayer-license) in your app.
4.  Add the OptiView Ads integration as a dependency to your project:
    <Tabs queryString="lang">
    <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
    <TabItem value="cocoapods" label="CocoaPods">
        1. Add the `THEOplayer-Integration-THEOads` pod to your Podfile:
        ```sh
        pod 'THEOplayer-Integration-THEOads', '~> 8.10.0'
        ```
        2. Install the new pod:
        ```sh
        pod install
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="swiftpm" label="SwiftPM">
         1. Open your Xcode project and navigate to File > Add Package Dependencies...

         ![Screenshot of Xcode file menu](../assets/img/ios-xcode-file-menu.png)

         2. Add `theoplayer-sdk-apple` package by entering the following url:
         ```sh
         https://github.com/THEOplayer/theoplayer-sdk-apple
         ```
         ![Screenshot of SwiftPM menu](../assets/img/ios-swiftpm-menu.png)

         3. Select `THEOplayerTHEOadsIntegration` from the package products list and add it to your target.

    </TabItem>
    <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
    </Tabs>

5.  Add Google IMA SDK as a dependency to your project:
    <Tabs queryString="lang">
    <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
    <TabItem value="cocoapods" label="CocoaPods">
        1. The `THEOplayer-Integration-THEOads` pod has a dependency on `GoogleAds-IMA-iOS-SDK` which should be installed automatically.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="swiftpm" label="SwiftPM">
         1. Open your Xcode project and navigate to File > Add Package Dependencies...

         ![Screenshot of Xcode file menu](../assets/img/ios-xcode-file-menu.png)

         2. Add `swift-package-manager-google-interactive-media-ads-ios` package by entering the following url:
         ```sh
         https://github.com/googleads/swift-package-manager-google-interactive-media-ads-ios
         ```
         ![Screenshot of SwiftPM menu](../assets/img/ios-swiftpm-menu-google.png)

         3. Select `GoogleInteractiveMediaAds` from the package products list and add it to your target.

         ![Screenshot of SwiftPM  product selection](../assets/img/ios-swiftpm-product-selection-google.png)

    </TabItem>
    <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
    </Tabs>

## Integration

To make use of the OptiView Ads integration, create and add the `THEOadsIntegration` to your `THEOplayer` instance:

```swift
import UIKit
import THEOplayerSDK
import THEOplayerTHEOadsIntegration

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var theoplayer: THEOplayer!
    var theoads: THEOadsIntegration!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.theoplayer = THEOplayer(configuration: THEOplayerConfigurationBuilder().build())
        self.theoplayer.frame = view.bounds
        self.theoplayer.addAsSubview(of: view)
        self.theoads = THEOadsIntegrationFactory.createIntegration(on: self.theoplayer)
        self.theoplayer.addIntegration(self.theoads)
    }

}
```

Then, configure a source containing a `THEOAdDescription`:

```swift
import UIKit
import THEOplayerSDK
import THEOplayerTHEOadsIntegration

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var theoplayer: THEOplayer!
    var theoads: THEOadsIntegration!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.theoplayer = THEOplayer(configuration: THEOplayerConfigurationBuilder().build())
        self.theoplayer.frame = view.bounds
        self.theoplayer.addAsSubview(of: view)
        self.theoads = THEOadsIntegrationFactory.createIntegration(on: self.theoplayer)
        self.theoplayer.addIntegration(self.theoads)

        let source = "PATH-TO-SIGNALING-SERVER/hls/MANIFEST-URI"
        let typedSource = TypedSource(
            src: source,
            type: "application/x-mpegurl",
            hlsDateRange: true
        )
        let theoad = THEOAdDescription(
            networkCode: "NETWORK-CODE",
            customAssetKey: "CUSTOM-ASSET-KEY"
        )
        let sourceDescription = SourceDescription(source: typedSource, ads: [theoad])
        self.theoplayer.source = sourceDescription
        self.theoplayer.play()
    }

}
```

- Notice that the `src` is different as usual. For OptiView Ads, a signaling server needs to be set up which acts as a proxy to parse the given manifest and insert the ad interstitials.
  More information can be found [here](signaling-service.mdx).
- The `hlsDateRange` flag needs to be set to `true` as the ad markers are done using `EXT-X-DATERANGE` tags.
- The `ads` array needs to contain a `THEOAdDescription`. Furthermore, the `networkCode` and `customAssetKey` needs to be set according to your configured Google account.
