# Tips and Tricks

This article will provide some dos and don'ts and some general information on how to write documentation in Markdown.

## Markdown

**A cheat sheet will all the Markdown features** can be
found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
An overview of Markdown features **specific to Docusaurus** can be
found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

If you're using Visual Code to write markdown files,
install this **great extension**:
[Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one).

## Naming convention directories and files

The order of the articles in the sidebar can be set in two ways:

- [Using the `sidebar_position` attribute in the front matter of your article.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#doc-item-metadata)

  ```markdown
  ---
  sidebar_position: 2
  ---

  # Title of the Article

  ...
  Content
  ...
  ```

- [Using a numeric prefix in the article's file name.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#using-number-prefixes)

  - Template: `category/xx-directory/yy-directory/zz-article-title.md`, with:
    - `xx`, `yy`, `zz` being numbers, and
    - `category` being 'knowledge-base', 'getting-started', 'how-to-guides' or 'faq'. Categories **don't** need a
      numerical prefix.
  - Example: A file that should show up in _Getting Started > SDKs > Web > Getting started on Web_, will have the
    following path:  
    `getting-started/01-sdks/01-web/00-getting-started.md`

:::warning
Using a numeric prefix is discouraged for new articles. When we need to change an article's position, we also need to
update _all internal links_ to that article.

```diff title="faq/some-article.md"
- See this [other article](../04-other-article.md)
+ See this [other article](../05-other-article.md)
```

:::

## A file should ALWAYS start with the article title

The first line of each document should contain a hashtag (#), followed with the title of the article. Documents that
don't follow this approach will be rejected!

**Example:**

```markdown
# Title of the Article

...
Content
...
```

## Always use backticks when using HTML tags

When using HTML tags like `<p>Some example</p>`, `<video>`,... always surround them with backticks `` `like this` ``.
Alternatively, you can put a backslash before the opening `<`, like this: `\<p>`

If not, Docusaurus will try to interpret it like an HTML tag or React component, which probably won't render correctly.

**Example:**

```markdown
`<p>Some example</p>`
\<p>Another example\</p>
```

## Using links

You can define a link in Markdown as follows:

```markdown
[this is a link](path-to-follow)
```

When linking to **another document**, use the **relative path**, including the file extension:

```markdown
[a relative link](../how-to-guides/01-ads/02-customizing-the-ad-overlay-text.md)
```

When linking to the **API reference**, use the **absolute path** along
with [the `pathname://` protocol](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets#static-assets):

```markdown
[ChromelessPlayer](pathname:///theoplayer/v7/api-reference/web/classes/ChromelessPlayer.html#constructor)
```

When linking to an **external page**:

```markdown
[link text](https://www.theoplayer.com)
```

## Using anchor links

When using anchor links: the link will look like `#title-of-section`. **Anchor links should always be in lower case!**

**Example:** we want to link to the section which has as title `SDKs`, and one with title `Code Examples`:

```markdown
[Anchor link to SDKs](#sdks)
[Anchor link to Code Examples](#code-examples)

## SDKs

...

## Code Examples

...
```

You can customize a header's anchor ID by adding `{#anchor-name}` at the
end ([documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/toc#heading-ids)).
This can be useful if the heading is very long, or if the heading contains special characters.

```markdown
[Anchor link to connect with custom receiver application](#custom-receiver-app)

## Connect with custom Chromecast Receiver application {#custom-receiver-app}

...
```

## Using images

**IMPORTANT:** the image name should NOT contain any spaces. If not following this rule, the image will not show up in
GitHub. Example: `my-image.png`.

Images can be stored anywhere in the project. Conventionally, we put them in an `assets` directory.

To insert an image in a document, use the **relative path**:

```markdown
An image will be shown below:

![Alt text](../../assets/img/image-15.png)
```

## Rules when inserting code blocks

When inserting a code block, always specify the language you're using so the code gets highlighted correctly.

- For Web, use ` ```js `
- For Android, use ` ```java `
- For iOS, use ` ```swift `

When you want to show code examples for different SDKs, make use of headings per SDK.

**Example**

````markdown
Let's see some code examples for the various SDKs.

### Web SDK

```js
function playingEventHandler(event) {
  var adIsPlaying = player.ads.playing;
  console.log('PLAYING', adIsPlaying ? 'Advertisement' : 'Content', event);
}

player.addEventListener('playing', playingEventHandler);
```

### Android SDK

```java
final EventListener<PlayingEvent> playingEventHandler = new EventListener<PlayingEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void handleEvent(PlayingEvent playingEvent) {
        tpv.getPlayer().getAds().requestPlaying(new RequestCallback<Boolean>() {
            @Override
            public void handleResult(Boolean adIsPlaying) {
                System.out.println("PLAYING " + (adIsPlaying ? "Advertisement" : "Content"));
            }
        });
    }
};
tpv.getPlayer().addEventListener(PlayerEventTypes.PLAYING, playingEventHandler);
```

### iOS/tvOS SDK and Legacy iOS/tvOS SDK (4.12.x)

```swift
self.eventListener = self.theoplayer.addEventListener(type: PlayerEventTypes.PLAYING) { [weak self] event in
    self.theoplayer?.ads.requestPlaying() { (result, _) in
        print("player.ads.playing = ", result!)
    }
}
```
````

Will result in:

:::note[Result]

Let's see some code examples for the various SDKs.

### Web SDK

```js
function playingEventHandler(event) {
  var adIsPlaying = player.ads.playing;
  console.log('PLAYING', adIsPlaying ? 'Advertisement' : 'Content', event);
}

player.addEventListener('playing', playingEventHandler);
```

### Android SDK

```java
final EventListener<PlayingEvent> playingEventHandler = new EventListener<PlayingEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void handleEvent(PlayingEvent playingEvent) {
        tpv.getPlayer().getAds().requestPlaying(new RequestCallback<Boolean>() {
            @Override
            public void handleResult(Boolean adIsPlaying) {
                System.out.println("PLAYING " + (adIsPlaying ? "Advertisement" : "Content"));
            }
        });
    }
};
tpv.getPlayer().addEventListener(PlayerEventTypes.PLAYING, playingEventHandler);
```

### iOS/tvOS SDK and Legacy iOS/tvOS SDK (4.12.x)

```swift
self.eventListener = self.theoplayer.addEventListener(type: PlayerEventTypes.PLAYING) { [weak self] event in
    self.theoplayer?.ads.requestPlaying() { (result, _) in
        print("player.ads.playing = ", result!)
    }
}
```
