## The Concept

You write General Information articles when you’re explaining something which does not really relate to the integration of THEOplayer. For example, when someone asks you “What is HLS?”, you could come up with HTTP Live Streaming.

The articles of this breed are informative, professional, and read like industry blog-posts/papers.

## Writing the Article

### Title of the Article

The title of the article should be the name of the concept.

**Examples**

- HTTP Live Streaming
- Server Side Ad Insertion

### Body of the Article

- The first header should be “Introduction”
- You’re at liberty to structure the rest of the article, but write it in a professional, objective manner.
- The last header should be a “Resources” section to link to relevant information, if applicable.

### Template

```markdown
