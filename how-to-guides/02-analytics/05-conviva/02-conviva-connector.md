## Code example

### Pre-requirements

##### Web SDK

1. Have a THEOplayer SDK.
2. Setup the [Basic Getting Started with THEOplayer](https://docs.portal.theoplayer.com/getting-started/01-sdks/01-web/00-getting-started.md) 
3. Include Conviva's SDK. For example,

```html
//Conviva Library Example
<script type='text/javascript' src='//cdn.theoplayer.com/conviva/conviva-4.0.15.js'></script>
```
* Note: You can download the latest conviva library from [Conviva Developer Community](https://community.conviva.com/site/global/home/p_home.gsp)
* You can use any version of Conviva library which support Video and Ads Analytics offering by Conviva. 

### Configuration

The snippets below explain how you can pass on Conviva settings to a THEOplayer configuration object.

##### Web SDK

1. Setting up of your conviva configurations like below: 

```js
        var TEST_CUSTOMER_KEY = '876a2328cc34e791190d855daf389567c96d1e86';
        var TOUCHSTONE_SERVICE_URL = 'https://theoplayer-test.testonly.conviva.com';
        var convivaConfigs = {};
        
        convivaConfigs[Conviva.Constants.GATEWAY_URL] = TOUCHSTONE_SERVICE_URL;
        convivaConfigs[Conviva.Constants.LOG_LEVEL] = Conviva.Constants.LogLevel.DEBUG;
        convivaConfigs[Conviva.Constants.CUSTOMER_KEY] = TEST_CUSTOMER_KEY;
```

2. a. Initialise THEOplayer-conviva plugin with the parameters including any manual metatdata for that particular asset. The below code can be used when you wish to pass manually different fields of metadata everytime associated with the source. 

```js
//Include the Script - THEOplayer Integrated Module with Conviva (Without Content Metadata function)
<script type='text/javascript' src='//cdn.theoplayer.com/conviva/conviva_theoplayer_plugin.js'></script>

//Prepare the metadata Content Info
var contentInfo = {};
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.ASSET_NAME] = assetName;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.STREAM_URL] = url;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.IS_LIVE] = Conviva.Constants.StreamType.LIVE; // Or Conviva.Constants.StreamType.VOD
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.PLAYER_NAME] = playerName;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.VIEWER_ID] = viewerId;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.DURATION] = duration;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.ENCODED_FRAMERATE] = encodedFps;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.DEFAULT_RESOURCE] = defaultResource;
contentInfo[ANY_TAG_KEY1] = "VALUE1";
contentInfo[ANY_TAG_KEY2] = "VALUE2";

//Initialise the THEOplayer Conviva Plugin with the defined Content Info 
var integration = new NewConvivaIntegration(player,convivaConfigs,contentInfo);

```
 
2. b. Initialise THEOplayer-conviva-metadata plugin with function MetatdataReciever for that asset. The below code can be used when you wish to pass a fixed fields of metadata everytime associated with the source. 

```js
//Include the Script - THEOplayer Integrated Module with Conviva (With Content MetadataReciever function)
<script type='text/javascript' src='//cdn.theoplayer.com/conviva/conviva_theoplayer_metadata_plugin.js'></script>

//Prepare a function which creates metadata ContentInfo when the source of the player is changed
function contentMetadataReceiver(){
var contentInfo = {};
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.ASSET_NAME] = assetName;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.STREAM_URL] = url;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.IS_LIVE] = Conviva.Constants.StreamType.LIVE; // Or Conviva.Constants.StreamType.VOD
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.PLAYER_NAME] = playerName;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.VIEWER_ID] = viewerId;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.DURATION] = duration;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.ENCODED_FRAMERATE] = encodedFps;
contentInfo[Conviva.Constants.DEFAULT_RESOURCE] = defaultResource;
contentInfo[ANY_TAG_KEY1] = "VALUE1";
contentInfo[ANY_TAG_KEY2] = "VALUE2";
return contentInfo;
}

//Initialise the THEOplayer Conviva Plugin with the defined Content Info 
var integration = new NewConvivaIntegration(player,convivaConfigs,contentMetadataReceiver);

```

*  Points to Remember:

    -  `player` in the `NewConvivaIntegration` is THEOplayer Object which needs to be initialised before conviva connector is initialised. 

    ```js
    var player = new THEOplayer.Player(element, { // instantiates video player
    libraryLocation : '/path/to/your-theoplayer-folder/' // references folder containing your THEOplayer library files (theoplayer.p.js, THEOplayer.js, ...)
    });
    ```
    
    - `convivaConfigs` are the details of the conviva and `contentMetadata` is the last parameter to add manually metadata associated to that content. All the params added to `contentInfo` should be a string.

    - `contentMetadataReceiver` is `(source) => contentMetadata`, also it might be needed to `bind(this)` the function. This function is automatically called again when the source of the player is changed. 

* Note:  You can also Clone the repo to have the local version of Plugin and include the file in the `script` tag. For debugging and development purposes, we have a debug version as well which can be used by replacing the URL with `conviva_theoplayer_metadata_plugin_debug.js`

* Conviva Connector has full support for Video and Ad Analytics offered by Conviva. This connector can be maintained and managed by accross teams as it is built using all public api's of THEOplayer and conviva. Any new updates or changes can be easily modified and customised as per customer requirements. (There is no dependancy on the THEOplayer or Conviva library version)
