# Introduction

The articles in this section describe how to implement common use-cases related to text tracks, subtitles, closed captions and metadata. These use-cases can range from programmatically detecting new metadata, to side-loading subtitles.

The Text Tracks add-on makes THEOplayer capable of supporting

- subtitle and closed caption formats, like WebVTT, CEA-608, DVB Subs and TTML;
- metadata formats, like ID3, emsg, EventStream and EXT-X-DATERANGE.

The Text Tracks add-on exposes the TextTracks API. This API allows developers to programmatically switch between text tracks, detect events related to text tracks (e.g. new active cue), and more.
