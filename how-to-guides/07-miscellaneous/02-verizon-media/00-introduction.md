# Introduction

THEOplayer and Verizon Media are partners in the streaming industry. The [Verizon Media Platform](https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/) offers services like encoding, transcoding, server-side ad-insertion, a CDN and more.

Verizon Media offers services which can enhance the API, UI and UX of video players and applications. The most popular services are called Preplay, Ping and Asset Info. THEOplayer integrates these services so that developers and viewers can benefit from them.

For example,

* Viewers can skip over ads;
* Viewers can see when an ad is playing (and stopping);
* Developers can define the behavior when viewers try to seek over an ad;
* Developers can query metadata to render a playlist in their application.
