# Getting started with React Native

This article describes how the THEOplayer iOS and Android SDKs can be wrapped to be used in a React Native project. 

## Creating a basic React Native project

The following instructions demonstrate how you can create a sample React Native project which contains THEOplayer. You can also clone a [sample React Native project](https://github.com/THEOplayer/samples-react-native) from our GitHub.

### Android

#### Pre-requisites

- React Native
- Node.js (NPM or yarn)
- Android Studio or SDK for Android
- Text Editor or IDE eg. SublimeText
- Terminal (OSX/Linux) or Command Line (Windows)
- THEOplayer Android SDK 

#### Steps

Start project:

- install app libs yarn,
- run project yarn run start.

Run emulator:

- open project folder `<path to project>/android`,
- add emulator device configuration(AVD Manager).

Add THEOplayer library in  project:
- go to File > New Module > Import .JAR / .AAR Package,
- navigate to the location where the lib .aar file is stored and select it,
- go to project dependencies by going to File > Project Structure > dependencies tab,
- add a new dependency by clicking the plus sign in the top-right corner and choose Module dependency. Select the lib .aar file and click OK.

SDK version project:

- open project build.gradle,
- in buildscript ext, change minSdkVersion to 21.

### iOS

#### Pre-requisites

- React Native
- Node.js (NPM or yarn)
- Android Studio or SDK for Android
- Text Editor or IDE eg. SublimeText
- Terminal (OSX/Linux) or Command Line (Windows)
- THEOplayer Android SDK 

#### Steps

Start Project:

- install app libs yarn,
- install pods pod install.

Run Project:

- open Xcode, add new project -> select workspace file in iOS folder generated after pod install,
- click run project, project will start automatically -> terminal & emulator will start.

## Remarks
Disclaimer: THEO Technologies does not provide THEOplayer React Native components. This How-to-Article describes how our current THEOplayer iOS and Android SDKs can be wrapped in React Native Bridges. The sample React Native bridge code is provided AS-IS without any explicit nor implicit guarantees. The React Native bridge sample code only provides mapping for a number of commonly used THEOplayer APIs, it is the customerâ€™s responsibility to further expand the mapping and subsequently maintain the code and ensure compatibility with future versions of THEOplayer SDKs.
