# Getting started with Angular

_A brief guide on how to build a THEOplayer in an Angular environment._

Note that this information is for a basic player in a local testing environment. Additional information may be needed for specific cases.

## Step-by-step guide:

1. Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

2. If needed, create a new workspace and initial application
   ng new appname

3. In the root project, create a new component for the player (in this case appname)

```
cd appname
ng generate component theoplayer
```

4. add the THEOplayer.js files to the root project
5. In index.html add the /THEOplayer.js as a script tag and /ui.css as a stylesheet
6. In theoplayer.component.html add

```html
<div class="theoplayer-container video-js theoplayer-skin"></div>
```

7. In theoplayer.component.ts add

```js
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import * as THEOplayer from '../../../THEOplayer.js';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-theoplayer',
  templateUrl: './theoplayer.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./theoplayer.component.css']
})
export class TheoplayerComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.createPlayer();
  }

  createPlayer() {
    const element = document.querySelector('.theoplayer-container');

    const player = new THEOplayer.Player(element, {
      libraryLocation : ''
    });

    player.source = {
     sources : [{
         src : '//cdn.theoplayer.com/video/elephants-dream/playlist.m3u8',
         type : 'application/x-mpegurl' // sets type to MPEG-DASH
     }]
 };
  }
}
```

Then

```js
import * as THEOplayer from '../../../THEOplayer.js;
```

will make sure to get everything needed from our sdk.

9. In app.component.html add the following code to display the player in the app component.

```js
<app-theoplayer></app-theoplayer>
```

10. Profit.
