# Authorization

To make secure calls to the THEOlive REST API, both authentication and authorization are required. THEOlive uses token–secret pairs to authorize API requests and ensure secure access.

## 1. Getting a token-secret pair

To generate a token–secret pair, you must first have an account on the [THEOlive management console](https://console.theo.live/).

1. Navigate to the _Developers section_ and click on "Tokens".
2. Click the "Generate Token" button.
3. Enter a name for your token.
4. Click "Generate" to create the token–secret pair.

This will open a pop-up displaying your token "key" and its corresponding secret.

:::warning[Please store the secret]

Make sure to securely store the secret, as it will only be shown once. THEOlive stores a hashed version of the secret, meaning it cannot be recovered afterward.

Once you close the pop-up window, the new token will be visible in your list of active tokens.

If you forget your secret or if it gets exposed, you can easily regenerate a new token–secret pair at any time.

To revoke a token, click the arrow icon under the "Actions" column and the token will be moved to the list of revoked tokens after confirmation.

## 2. Using the token-secret pair with Basic Authentication

THEOlive uses Basic Authentication for API requests. To authenticate, include your token-secret pair (base64-encoded) in the 'Authorization' header, prepended with the word 'Basic'.

Here’s an example of how to set up the header:

1. Combine your token and secret in the format `token:secret`.
   Example: `my-token:my-secret`

2. Base64 encode the combined value.
   Example: `bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0`

3. Include the encoded string in the Authorization header, prefixed with the word Basic.
   Example header: `Authorization: Basic bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0`

4. The final Authorization header should look like this: `Authorization: Basic bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0`

You’re now ready to make authenticated requests to the THEOlive API.
