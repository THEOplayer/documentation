# How to manage your team

After signing up for the [THEOlive console](https://console.theo.live/login), you may want to collaborate with your colleagues using the same account and channels. This guide walks you through how to set up team access and collaboration.

## 1. Manage your team

### 1.1 - Access the team

Click on the ‚ÄúMy account‚Äù button, on the top right-hand corner of the screen and select _My Team_.

This section displays all members of your team along with their current status. Each member is assigned a role as either an admin or user.

:::warning üöß Only admins can access the _My Team_ section
The _My Team_ section is only visible to admins. If you don‚Äôt see the _My team_ button, it means you currently don‚Äôt have admin rights. You can find more information about roles in the section below.

### 1.2 - Add member

To invite a colleague, click on the _Add member_ button. Enter their email address, select their role, and click _Add_ to confirm.

An invitation has been sent to the specified email address, including a link and instructions to access the THEOlive console.

If needed, you can resend the invitation from the _My Team_ page by clicking the envelope icon next to the user's name (see screenshot below).

Once your colleagues accept the invitation, they‚Äôll have access to the same console account. The _My Team_ page will then display them as part of your team.

## 2. Determining the role of your new team members

There are two roles defined in the THEOlive console: **admin** and **user**. While both roles have access to most of the same information and actions, admins have a few additional permissions.

Admins can:

- Access team management and billing pages
- Grant or revoke admin access for other team members
- Remove members from the team
- Revoke tokens

Users can perform most day-to-day tasks but do not have access to team management, billing, or token revocation.

## 3. Complete your profile

When a user is invited to a THEOlive team, they gain access to the _My Profile_ page. Here, they can update their personal details, including first name, last name, phone number, and password.

Access to this page is restricted to the individual user. Neither other team members nor admins can view or edit someone else‚Äôs personal information.
