# THEOlive

THEOlive is a low latency streaming solution. For more information about the backend configuration, go the the
[console](https://console.theo.live) or consult the [documentation](https://developers.theo.live/docs/welcome). The recommended
way to play these streams are using THEOplayer. THEOlive sources are not really different from other sources so most
of the regular THEOplayer documentation is relevant for THEOlive playback.

We recommend the following steps:

1. First you should [configure THEOplayer in your page](../theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/getting-started).
2. The next step is [configuring the correct type of source](../theoplayer/how-to-guides/web/theolive/getting-started).

And that's it, you now have a THEOplayer instance that can play the THEOlive source. Now you can interact with the player
in all kinds of ways, like calling methods and listening to events as explained in this [guide](../theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/api-examples).
