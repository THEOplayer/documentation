# Multi-audio support

---

The Dolby OptiView platform supports multi-audio ingest and delivery with our HESP solution. This functionality is perfect for 
use cases such as live events where multiple languages or commentary may be required.

:::caution
This functionality is **only** supported through the SRT Pull ingest method. Playback is **only** supported on web.

## Configuring multi-audio ingest and playback

To deliver multi audio SRT the following steps must be taken: 
1. Within your dashboard configure your SRT listener endpoint.
2. Configure your expected incoming "Audio tracks" by specifying a language, label, and the expected PID.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

</div>

3. Start the Channel and begin ingesting video and audio into the engine.
4. Your output will be available for playback on web only via the [channel alias](../multi-channel).
5. You can validate the audio tracks are being delivered via the demo player : `https://demo.theo.live/?channel=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID`

## Feature Compatibility and Limitations
