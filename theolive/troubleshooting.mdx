| Why is my corporate VPN having issues when playing THEOlive streams? | In the past, we have seen 2 possible reasons for poor VPN playback: <br/> - The VPN might have a security gateway that does packet inspection. It is very important that all THEOlive domains are whitelisted so network requests are allowed to go through the VPN at real-time speeds. <br/> - The overhead of the VPN connection does not meet the bandwidth & network stability to play. |
| Packet inspection                                                    | Packet inspection software (e.g. Zscaler) can have a negative impact on play-out causing buffering and stalling of the THEOlive stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
