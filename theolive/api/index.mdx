# THEOlive REST API

import SidebarCategoryDocCardList from '@site/src/components/SidebarCategoryDocCardList';

THEOlive provides a REST API to manage channels, receive events, create reports, and set up webhooks.

Alternatively, you can perform the most common actions directly from the THEOlive management console.
See [our getting started guide](/theolive/getting-started.mdx) for more information.
