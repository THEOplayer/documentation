## Haivision KB

To get started, log into your Dolby OptiView dashboard. Enter your KB web interface, switch views to the Channel Control Center, and create a new channel.

Follow the Create Channel Wizard prompts to create a channel as normal:

1. Enter the desired channel name.
2. Identify your live source for the channel input.
3. Choose RTMP for the channel output and copy the RTMP publish path from the Dolby _channel_ you have created.  
   RTMP URL: `rtmps://rtmp.<my-channel-region>.hesp.live/live`
4. Enter the RTMP publish stream name from the ingest server section.  
   Stream Name: `<my-stream-key>`

import RtmpPush from '../../assets/img/hardware-encoders/theolive-ingest-server-rtmp-push.png';

<div class="center-container">
  <img src={RtmpPush} width="500" />
</div>

With the broadcast credentials set up, the stream is ready to go live. To view the stream, scroll down to the _Playout configurations_ section in your channel page and start the player.

\*Note: The timestamp seeding seemed to be the magic change on the KBs.

:::info 🚧 Frame rate and bandwidth
Remember to set the frame rate to the same value as in your THEOlive channel ingest configuration and make sure that your encoder has a stable connection and enough upload bandwidth. See [Stream configuration](../stream-configuration.mdx) for more details.
