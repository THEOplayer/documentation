# In-stream metadata through SEI messages

---

THEOlive allows you to embed metadata into your stream that is preserved throughout the THEOlive pipeline and can be accessed by the player.

The first step is adding the metadata to your (h264) input stream in the form of picture timing SEI messages as defined in ITUT H264 Annex D 1.3. These messages allow you to add a timestamp to your frames and associate the timestamp with an event that happened on your backend.

The next step is [listening to these messages in the player](../playback/web/metadata.mdx).
