# Using FFmpeg with THEOlive

**FFmpeg** is a free open-source software project with command-line tools for handling video, audio, and other multimedia. It is common practice to use Ffmpeg in production workflows when broadcasting from a media file on disk.

Broadcasts are started using the `ffmpeg` command-line to forward a source using RTMP broadcast contribution protocol to stream content to THEOlive.

See the official [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/) documentation for installation instructions and additional support.

ffmpeg -re -stream_loop -1 -i $VIDEO_FILE_PATH \
  -vcodec libx264 \

:::info Upload bandwidth
Make sure that your encoder has a stable connection and enough upload bandwidth. This will ensure all data is correctly sent to the THEOlive channel.
