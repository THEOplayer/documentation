# Using OBS with THEOlive

**Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)** is a free open-source software created for broadcasting and recording on your desktop. You can take advantage of this tool to stream high-quality video to your viewers using THEOlive.

See the official [obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com) documentation for installation instructions and additional support about using OBS.

:::tip Getting Started
If you haven't already, begin by following the [Getting Started](/theolive/getting-started.mdx) tutorial to create a THEOlive channel and start your first broadcast.
:::

## Setting up a broadcast

### 1. Add a source

In the _Source_ section at the bottom of the OBS application, hit the + sign to add a new source. For example, selecting "Media Source" allows you to select an existing media file stored on your machine. Selecting "Display Capture" will record your screen. Selecting "Video capture device" will allow you to select a video input device like a webcam.

### 2. Configure stream settings

Select _Settings_ in the _Controls_ section at the bottom right of the OBS application. Click on the _Stream_ tab on the left menu bar and configure the following:

- Select "Custom..." as the _Service_
- Copy your `rtmpPushUrl` from the channel details page in the THEOlive dashboard URL as _Server_
- Copy your `streamKey` from the channel details page in the THEOlive dashboard as _Stream Key_

Next, go to the _Output_ tab in the _Settings_ menu, and configure the following settings in order to achieve the lowest possible latency using THEOlive.

- Output Mode: `Advanced`
- Bitrate: match the max bitrate of the profile used in your channel (e.g.: 4500Kbps for "sport"). [More details](../stream-configuration.mdx).
- Keyframe interval: `0s`
- CPU Usage Preset (higher = less CPU): `veryfast`
- Profile: `main`
- Tune: `zerolatency`

Lastly, go to the _Video_ tab and set the frame rate to the same value you have set in your THEOlive channel. See [Stream configuration](../stream-configuration.mdx) for more details.
