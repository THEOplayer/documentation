# Using Wirecast with THEOlive

This guide explains to you how to set up Wirecast correctly so it can be used to stream your content with THEOlive.

## 1. Configure Output Settings

- Select "Output" from the toolbar
- Subsequently select "Output Settings..."

- Select "RTMP Server" as the output destination and choose "OK".

- Go to the THEOlive management console, and copy the RTMP Push URL and Stream key of your channel.
- Paste the RTMP Push URL into "Address".

:::warning ‚ùóÔ∏è Not all versions/editions of Wirecast support RTMPS
Definitely check whether your Wirecast version/edition supports RTMPS. Older versions typically do not support RTMPS, whereas for example the most recent version Professional version does support RTMPS. In case your version/edition does not accept RTMPS, then definitely change "RTMPS" to "RTMP" in your RTMP push URL. As an example rtmps://rtmp.europe-west.hesp.live/live will have to be changed to rtmp://rtmp.europe-west.hesp.live/live for RTMP-based streaming.
:::

- Paste the Streamkey into "Stream:"

- Select your "Encoding" settings (max 1080p)
- Subsequently review your detailed encoding settings by clicking the settings button next to encoding, and selecting "view details"

- Define the appropriate encoder latency, taking into account your computer performance. "1 - (Ultra Fast encoding)" will give the lowest latency as it requires the least CPU time.
- Also select the encoding "Profile". For example, "Main" will give lower latencies than "High" but on the other hand "High" will provide for better quality than "Main".
- Lastly, set "Frames per second" to the same value used in the THEOlive channel ingest config and set "Average bit rate" to match the max bitrate of the channel preset. See [Stream configuration](../stream-configuration.mdx) for more details.
- Click "OK" and move to step 2 to add your live stream.

Make sure that your encoder has a stable connection and enough upload bandwidth. This will ensure all data is correctly sent to the THEOlive channel.
