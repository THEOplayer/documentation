# Getting started with THEOlive on React Native

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](/theoplayer/getting-started/frameworks/react-native/getting-started/)
   to set up THEOplayer in your React Native app.
2. Add a THEOlive source to your player's source.

### Add a THEOlive source

After setting up your THEOplayer on your web page, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `THEOliveSource`.
You'll need a THEOlive channel ID:

```javascript
player.source = {
  sources: {
    type: 'theolive',
    src: 'your-channel-id',
  },
};
```
