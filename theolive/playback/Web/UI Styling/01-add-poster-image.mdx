For a more detailed overview about player customisation, please see the [Player documentation](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/getting-started/).

You can show a poster image before playback starts by setting the `poster` attribute on the player container or via JavaScript:

```html
<div id="theoplayer" poster="https://yourdomain.com/poster.jpg"></div>
```

Or dynamically:

```js
player.source = {
  poster: 'https://yourdomain.com/poster.jpg',
  sources: [
    {
      src: 'https://yourstream.com/hls/live.m3u8',
      type: 'application/x-mpegURL',
    },
  ],
};
```
