For a more detailed overview about player customisation, please see the [Player documentation](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/getting-started/).

To display your logo in the corner of the player:

```html
<div class="player-wrapper">
  <div id="theoplayer"></div>
  <img src="/logo.png" class="logo-overlay" alt="Brand Logo" />
</div>
```

```css
.logo-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  right: 10px;
  width: 100px;
  z-index: 10;
}
```

Ensure your parent container has `position: relative;` to align overlays properly.
