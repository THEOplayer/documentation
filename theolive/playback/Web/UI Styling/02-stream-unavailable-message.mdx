For a more detailed overview about player customisation, please see the [Player documentation](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/getting-started/).

If no stream is currently available or token authentication fails, show a fallback message:


## SDKs

Error handling is available across platforms and SDKs.

| Web SDK | Android SDK | iOS SDK | tvOS SDK | Android TV SDK | Chromecast SDK |
| :-----: | :---------: | :-----: | :------: | :------------: | :------------: |
|   Yes   |     Yes     |   Yes   |   Yes    |      Yes       |      Yes       |

## Intercepting errors

Developers can programmatically interact with errors in two ways:

1. Through an event listener, and attaching an event handler to this listener
2. Through a getter, which holds data when an error has occurred.

### Event Listener

Developers can subscribe to events and attach a callback function.
This callback function implements the error handling.

This section describes how to use event handlers for the "top-level", "generic", "player" `error` event.
This is the [`error`](pathname:///theoplayer/v9/api-reference/web/interfaces/PlayerEventMap.html#error) event which is dispatched through the `Player` interface.
This event is fatal and prevents playback.
(There are also `error` events, for example the [`error`](pathname:///theoplayer/v9/api-reference/web/interfaces/ChromecastEventMap.html#error) event which is dispatched through the `Chromecast` interface.
You handle these `error` events in the same fashion.)

#### Web

```js
player.addEventListener('error', function (errorEvent) {
  console.log(errorEvent);
});
```

#### Android

```java
theoPlayerView.getPlayer().addEventListener(PlayerEventTypes.ERROR, new EventListener<ErrorEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void handleEvent(ErrorEvent errorEvent) {
        System.out.println(errorEvent.getErrorObject());
    }
});
```

#### iOS

```swift
let listener = self.theoplayer?.addEventListener(type: PlayerEventTypes.ERROR, listener: { error in print(error.error)})
```

### Getter

Developers can query an occurred "generic player error" through the `errorObject` property of its related interface.
For example, if the `error` event of the top-level `Player` interface would be dispatched for the Web SDK,
then you can access the `errorObject` property of this interface.

```js
player.addEventListener('error', function (errorEvent) {
  // console.log(errorEvent);
  console.log(player.errorObject);
});
```

Note that other types of errors are not available through this approach.
