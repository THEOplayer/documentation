# Further Feature Support

The Dolby OptiView Streaming platform uses the [OptiView Player](https://docs.optiview.dolby.com/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/getting-started/) for playback. Because this player operates on the client side, it may support additional features beyond basic streaming â€” such as UI controls, ad insertion, or advanced APIs.

However, not all features available in the OptiView Player have been tested or verified with HESP-based OptiView streams. Some capabilities may work as expected, while others might be incompatible or require additional integration.

If you're exploring extended functionality, we recommend checking the [OptiView Player documentation](https://docs.optiview.dolby.com/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/getting-started/) for potential capabilities. Keep in mind that any features not explicitly documented by the OptiView team are not officially supported within our Streaming solution. For guidance on implementation or to confirm compatibility, please reach out to the OptiView support team.
