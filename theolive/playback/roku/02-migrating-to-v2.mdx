# Migrating to THEOlive v2

If you are using THEOlive v2 for your live streams, you will need to do some extra configuration to successfully play back your THEOlive streams on Roku.

## Initial Setup

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/roku/getting-started)
   to set up THEOplayer in your Roku app.
2. Add a THEOlive source to your player's source.

### Configure THEOlive for v2

THEOlive v2 sources do not use the default discovery URL (https://discovery.theo.live/v2/publications/). In order to use v2, you will need to specify one or more discovery URLs. On the player configuration object, you may add the discovery URLs using the `theoLive` property on the player configuration.

```brightscript
playerConfiguration = {
  license: "<YOUR_LICENSE_HERE>",
  theoLive: {
    discoveryUrls: ["https://discovery.theo.live/v2/distributions/"]
  }
}
m.player.callFunc("configure", playerConfiguration)
```
