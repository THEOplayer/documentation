# Getting started with THEOlive on Roku

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/roku/getting-started)
   to set up THEOplayer in your Roku app.
2. Add a THEOlive source to your player's source.

### Add a THEOlive source

After setting up your THEOplayer on your App, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `THEOliveSource`.
You'll need a THEOlive channel ID:

```brightscript
m.THEOsdk.source = {
    "live": true,
    "sources": {
      "src": "your-channel-id",
      "type": "theolive"
    }
}
```

Please note that the playlist feature cannot be used with THEOlive. On Roku the THEOlive source falls back to the HLS stream.
