# Getting started with THEOlive on Roku

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/roku/getting-started)
   to set up THEOplayer in your Roku app.
2. Add a THEOlive source to your player's source.

### Add a THEOlive source

After setting up your THEOplayer on your App, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `THEOliveSource`.
You'll need a THEOlive channel ID:

```brightscript
m.THEOsdk.source = {
    "live": true,
    "sources": {
      "src": "your-channel-id",
      "type": "theolive"
    }
}
```

Please note that the playlist feature cannot be used with THEOlive. On Roku the THEOlive source falls back to the HLS stream.

### Configure THEOlive

On the player configuration object, you may add extra configuration using the `theoLive` property on the player configuration. For instance, if you would like to provide an external ID to track the session, you may add it to the `theoLive` configuration:

```brightscript
playerConfiguration = {
  license: "<YOUR_LICENSE_HERE>",
  theoLive: {
    externalSessionId: "my-unique-id"
  }
}
m.player.callFunc("configure", playerConfiguration)
```
