# Airplay

THEOlive streams have support for Airplay. However, a limitation for now is that the latency is higher while
casting (about 12 seconds). Configuring it is exactly the same as for other streams you would play with THEOplayer.
The instructions are described in the [Airplay guide](/theoplayer/how-to-guides/cast/airplay/introduction/).
