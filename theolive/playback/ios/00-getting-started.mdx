# Getting started with THEOlive on iOS

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/getting-started)
   to set up THEOplayer in your iOS app.
2. Add a THEOlive source to your player's source.

### Add a THEOlive source

After setting up your THEOplayer in your app, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `TheoLiveSource`.
You'll need a THEOlive channel ID:

```swift
theoplayer.source = SourceDescription(source: TheoLiveSource(channelId: "3aa5qylwwk7gijsobayq09yee"))
```
