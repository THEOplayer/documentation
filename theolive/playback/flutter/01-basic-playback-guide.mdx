# Basic Playback Guide

After following our [Getting Started with Flutter guide](./00-getting-started.mdx) or the [Player Setup](#player-setup) section below, you will be ready to programmatically perform common playback actions. These include increasing/decreasing
the volume, playing/pausing the stream, enabling full screen, and selecting quality layers.

## Player Setup

To get started with THEOlive playback using Flutter, you must first initialize a THEOplayer instance and set a THEOlive source.

Here is example code of initializing a THEOplayer instance with Flutter:

```dart
late THEOplayer player;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();

  player = THEOplayer(
      theoPlayerConfig: THEOplayerConfig(
        license: "YOUR_PLAYER_LICENSE_STRING",
        // Extra THEOlive configuration - set a custom sessionId to follow the requests on the backend
        theolive: TheoLiveConfiguration(externalSessionId: "mySessionID"),
      ),
  )
}

player.source = SourceDescription(sources: [
    TheoLiveSource(src: "2vqqekesftg9zuvxu9tdme6kl"),
]);
```

## Adjust Volume

To adjust the volume of your stream during playback, you can set the `volume` property to a floating point number in the range of 0.0 (0%) minimum and 1.0 (100%) maximum.

The following code sets the player's volume to 50%:

```dart
// the stream's volume will now be 50%
player.volume = 0.5;
```

## Play/Pause Stream

To play or pause your stream, you can use the `play` and `pause` methods available on your player variable.

To pause your stream:

```dart
player.pause();
```

To play your stream:

```dart
player.play();
```

## Enable Full Screen

To make your stream take up the full screen of the device it is being viewed upon, you must use the `setPresentationMode` method.

The `setPresentationMode` method can accept the following arguments:

- `'INLINE'`: The player is shown in its original location on the page. (default presentation mode)
- `'FULLSCREEN'`: The player fills the entire screen.
- `'PIP'`: (Picture-in-picture) The player is shown on top of the page (see PiPConfiguration for more options).

To make the current stream take up the full screen, pass a presentationMode of 'fullscreen' to the requestMode method with the following code:

```dart
// stream will take up the full screen which it is being viewed on
player.setPresentationMode('FULLSCREEN');
```

To confirm that the change has occured, check the `getPresentationMode` property to ensure it now returns `fullscreen` as its value:

```dart
// should return a value of 'fullscreen' to the console
print('this is the current presentation mode being used --> ${player.getPresentationMode()}');
```

## Select Quality Layer

To select a specific quality layer during the playing of your stream, you must set the `targetQuality` property of your player's `videoTracks` property.

The `videoTracks` property leverages the Video Tracks API and will allow you to see all quality layers available, the current active quality layer, and set a new target quality layer.

To see what qualities you have available, use the following code:

```dart
// import needed to use the 'inspect' function
import 'dart:developer';

// inspect all available quality layers
var qualities = player.videoTracks.first.qualities.innerList;
inspect("this is an array containing all available qualities --> ${qualities}");
```

Once you know what options you have available, you can set the stream to be a specific quality with the following:

```dart
// set the first quality layer in the array to be the target quality layer
player.videoTracks.first.targetQuality = player.videoTracks.first.qualities.first;
```
