# Getting Started with Flutter

## Usage

We have migrated THEOlive Flutter support to be a feature of the THEOplayer Flutter SDK.

To use Flutter for THEOlive playback, you must use the [THEOplayer Flutter SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/theoplayer) which now supports Web, Android, and iOS devices. The following steps will ensure your project is setup optimally:

1. Review the [THEOplayer Flutter SDK limitations](/theoplayer/flutter/guides/limitations/) to ensure your use case needs are supported before starting development.
2. Follow along with the [THEOplayer Flutter SDK minimal setup guide](/theoplayer/flutter/guides/creating-minimal-app/) to setup a basic THEOlive project.
3. Check the [THEOlive support guide](/theoplayer/flutter/guides/theolive/) for the latest THEOlive Flutter updates.

For customers currently using the now deprecated THEOlive SDK for playback, please migrate to using the THEOplayer SDK with the following [THEOlive migration guide](/theoplayer/flutter/guides/theolive/#migration-from-theolive-flutter-sdk-to-theoplayer-flutter-sdk)
to always have the latest updates.

### Flutter project setup

Run the following script to generate boilerplate code for your Flutter project:

```bash
$ flutter create -a kotlin -i swift -t app --org com.theoplayer --description "New THEOlive project" --project-name "theolive_sample_app" --platform ios,android theolive_sample_app
```

### Initializing a THEOplayer instance

Configure the THEOplayer by setting your THEOplayer license on the `license` property and optionally providing a `theolive` property for custom configuration:

```dart
late THEOplayer player;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();

  player = THEOplayer(
      theoPlayerConfig: THEOplayerConfig(
        license: "YOUR_PLAYER_LICENSE_STRING",
        // Extra THEOlive configuration - set a custom sessionId to follow the requests on the backend
        theolive: TheoLiveConfiguration(externalSessionId: "mySessionID"),
      ),
      onCreate: () {
        print("THEOplayer is created and ready to use");
      });
}
```

### Add a THEOlive source

After initializing a THEOplayer instance in your Flutter project, set its source with a `SourceDescription` containing a `TheoLiveSource`:

```
// a THEOlive channel ID is entered for the theoLiveSource 'src' property
player.source = SourceDescription(sources: [
    TheoLiveSource(src: "2vqqekesftg9zuvxu9tdme6kl"),
]);
```

### Next steps

If you've followed the steps above, you should now have a boilerplate THEOlive Flutter application to further develop your project from.

Use Flutter documentation along with our [basic playback guide](./01-basic-playback-guide.mdx) for Flutter to develop your project.
