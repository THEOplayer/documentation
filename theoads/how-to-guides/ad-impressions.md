# THEOads impressions

When playing a THEOads ad break, the player will send a beacon to our THEOplayer server to track the impressions.
This happens for each `adbreakbegin` event.

## Information tracked

The information passed only contains an identifier of the THEOplayer license build so the impressions are linked to the customer.
No information about the viewers is passed along.

## View my impressions

You can view your ad impressions on the portal dashboard underneath the THEOplayer license impressions.
