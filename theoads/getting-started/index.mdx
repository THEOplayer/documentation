# Getting started with THEOads

THEOads is a service where we use Server Guided Ad Insertion (SGAI) to deliver ads in your content.
This has multiple advantages over Client-Side Ad Insertion (CSAI) and Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI).
Some advantages include:

- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Tune-in

THEOads enhances ad playback quality and experience while enabling innovative ad formats and simplifying ad delivery.

## Integration

Setting up THEOads requires some small changes to your THEOplayer build, as well as setting up a signaling server.

:::note
Currently only HLS streams are supported. In the future DASH and HESP streams will also be supported.
:::

Each platform as well as the signaling service has its own getting started guide.
