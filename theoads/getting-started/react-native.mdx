# Getting started with OptiView Ads on React Native

This guide will get you started with OptiView Ads in your THEOplayer React Native SDK: configure the license, update dependencies and set the source description.

## Prerequisites

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

1.  You need to have a THEOplayer license which is compatible with OptiView Ads. This can be done through the [player portal](https://portal.theoplayer.com).
2.  You need a working [OptiView Ads signaling service](signaling-service.mdx).
3.  Enable the OptiView Ads integration based on the target platform:
    <Tabs queryString="platform">
        <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
        <TabItem value="android" label="Android & Android TV">
            The Android SDK is modular-based, so to enable OptiView Ads, simply include the extension by setting this flag in your gradle.properties:
            ```groovy
            # Enable THEOplayer Extensions (default: disabled)
            THEOplayer_extensionTHEOads = true
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS & tvOS">
            To enable OptiView Ads you can add the "THEOADS" feature flag to react-native-theoplayer.json (or theoplayer-config.json)
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="web" label="Web">
            Add a dependency to a THEOads-enabled THEOplayer package:
            ```bash
            $ npm i theoplayer@npm:@theoplayer/theoads
            ```

            In addition, since OptiView Ads integrates with Google DAI Pod Serving, it is required to load the Google DAI script on your page:

            ```html
            <script src="https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/sdkloader/ima3_dai.js"></script>
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

    </Tabs>

## Integration

This guide assumes you know how to set up React Native with THEOplayer.
For more information regarding this check out the [THEOplayer getting started](/theoplayer/getting-started/frameworks/react-native/getting-started/).

### Player configuration

To make use of the OptiView Ads integration, only a specific source needs to be set:

```javascript
player.source = {
  sources: {
    src: 'PATH-TO-SIGNALING-SERVER/hls/MANIFEST-URI',
    type: 'application/x-mpegurl',
    hlsDateRange: true,
  },
  ads: [
    {
      integration: 'theoads',
      networkCode: 'NETWORK-CODE',
      customAssetKey: 'CUSTOM-ASSET-KEY',
      backdropDoubleBox: 'PATH-TO-DOUBLE-BOX-BACKDROP-IMAGE', // Optional
      backdropLShape: 'PATH-TO-L-SHAPE-BACKDROP-IMAGE', // Optional
    },
  ],
};
```

- Notice that the `src` is different as usual. For OptiView Ads, a signaling server needs to be set up which acts as a proxy to parse the given manifest and insert the ad interstitials.
  More information can be found [here](signaling-service.mdx).
- The `hlsDateRange` flag needs to be set to `true` as the ad markers are done using `EXT-X-DATERANGE` tags.
- The `ads` object needs to have its integration set to `theoads`. Furthermore, the `networkCode` and `customAssetKey` needs to be set according to your configured Google account.
