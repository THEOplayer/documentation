# Getting started with THEOads on iOS

This guide will get you started with THEOads in your THEOplayer iOS SDK.

## Prerequisites

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

1. You need to have a THEOplayer license which is compatible with THEOads.
   This can be obtained through [https://portal.theoplayer.com](https://portal.theoplayer.com).
2. You need a working [THEOads signaling service](00-getting-started-signaling-service.mdx).
3. Add the THEOplayer iOS SDK to your project by following our [Getting started](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/getting-started) guide.
   Make sure to [set up a THEOads-compatible license](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/getting-started/#adding-the-theoplayer-license)
   in your app.
4. Add the THEOads integration as a dependency in to your project:
   <Tabs queryString="lang">
      <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
      <TabItem value="spm" label="Swift Package Manager">
       ```swift
       .package(url: "https://github.com/theoplayer/theoplayer-sdk-spm.git", from: "8.0.0")
       .product(name: "THEOplayerTheoAdsIntegration", package: "theoplayer-sdk-spm")
       ```
       </TabItem>
       <TabItem value="cocoapods" label="Cocoapods">
       ```
       pod 'THEOplayer-Integration-TheoAds', '~> 8.0'
       ```
       </TabItem>
       <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
   </Tabs>

## Integration

### Create integration

To make use of the THEOads integration, create a `TheoAdsIntegration` with a `THEOplayer` instance:

```swift
import THEOplayerSDK
import THEOplayerTheoAdsIntegration

let player = THEOplayer()
let theoAdsIntegration = TheoAdsIntegration(player: player)
```

:::note

Make sure you keep a reference to your `TheoAdsIntegration` instance. Whenever you derefence it Theo Ads will stop working.

### Set a source with ads

Then, configure a source containing a `TheoAdDescription`:

```swift
player.source = .init(
    source: TypedSource(
        src: "PATH-TO-SIGNALING-SERVER/hls/MANIFEST-URI",
        type: "application/x-mpegurl",
        hlsDateRange: true
    ),
    ads: [
        TheoAdDescription(
            networkCode: "NETWORK-CODE",
            customAssetKey: "CUSTOM-ASSET-KEY",
            backdropDoubleBox: URL(string: "PATH-TO-DOUBLE-BOX-BACKDROP-IMAGE"),
            backdropLShape: URL(string: "PATH-TO-L-SHAPE-BACKDROP-IMAGE")
        )
    ]
)
```

:::note

- The `src` is different as usual. For THEOads, a signaling server needs to be set up which acts as a proxy to parse the given manifest and insert the ad interstitials. More information can be found [here](00-getting-started-signaling-service.mdx).
- The `hlsDateRange` flag needs to be set to `true` as the ad markers are done using `EXT-X-DATERANGE` tags.
- The `ads` object needs to be a `TheoAdDescription`. Furthermore, the `networkCode` and `customAssetKey` needs to be set according to your configured Google account.
