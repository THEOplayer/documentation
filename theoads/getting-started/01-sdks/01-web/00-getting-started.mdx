# Getting started with THEOads

THEOads is a service where we use Server Guided Ad Insertion (SGAI) to deliver ads in your content.
This has multiple advantages over Client-Side Ad Insertion (CSAI) and Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI).
Some advantages include:

- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Tune-in

THEOads enhances ad playback quality and experience while enabling innovative ad formats and simplifying ad delivery.

## Integration

Setting up THEOads requires some small changes to your THEOplayer build, as well as setting up a signaling server.

:::note
Currently only HLS streams are supported. In the future DASH and HESP streams will also be supported.
:::

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Your THEOplayer SDK needs to have the 'theoads' feature enabled.

The THEOads feature is only included in the `@theoplayer/theoads` package which can be installed by executing the following command:

``` bash
npm install @theoplayer/theoads
```

#### 2. You need to have a THEOplayer license which is compatible with THEOads

This can be done through [https://portal.theoplayer.com](https://portal.theoplayer.com).


### Signaling Server

The signaling server is the heart of THEOads. It will parse the manifest and insert the ads based on the given information.
For more detailed information about the signaling server and the manifest requirements we refer to its own page: [Signaling Server](../signaling-server).

#### Installation

Installing the signaling server can be done through Ansible.

TO BE FILLED IN WHENEVER WE HAVE THIS PROCESS FINALIZED.

### Player configuration

This guide assumes you know how to set up THEOplayer. For more information regarding this check out the [THEOplayer getting started](/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/getting-started/).

To use the THEOads integration, only a specific source needs to be set:

```javascript
player.source = {
  sources: {
      src: 'PATH-TO-SIGNALING-SERVER/hls/MANIFEST-URI',
      type: 'application/x-mpegurl',
      hlsDateRange: true
  },
  ads: [
      {
          integration: 'theoads',
          networkCode: 'NETWORK-CODE',
          customAssetKey: 'CUSTOM-ASSET-KEY',
          backdropDoubleBox: 'PATH-TO-DOUBLE-BOX-BACKDROP-IMAGE', // Optional
          backdropLShape: 'PATH-TO-L-SHAPE-BACKDROP-IMAGE' // Optional
      }
  ]
};
```

- Notice that the `src` is different as usual. For THEOads, a signaling server needs to be set up which acts as a proxy to parse the given manifest and insert the ad interstitials.
More information can be found [here](#signaling-server).
- The `ads` object needs to have its integration set to `theoads`. Furthermore, the `networkCode` and `customAssetKey` needs to be set according to your configured Google account.
