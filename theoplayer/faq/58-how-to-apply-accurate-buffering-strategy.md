# How to apply accurate buffering strategy

By default, THEOplayer buffers 20 seconds of video including audio/subtitles in order to guarantee smooth playout.
THEOplayer (alike other Web players) is relying on [HTML SourceBuffer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SourceBuffer) for buffering purposes.
Unfortunately there is no method which informs you how big the buffer size of given browser/device is. Of course, it can be different for device, and even browser.
In consequence in edge circumstances might happen that the following error is encountered:
`Player error: Failed to execute 'appendBuffer' on 'SourceBuffer': The SourceBuffer is full, and cannot free space to append additional buffers.`

## Proactive strategy

One of the approach to deal with above issue is to apply proactive strategy which adjust `player.abr.targetBuffer` depending on what quality is currently used.
The below table presents what approximately bandwidth is required for video streaming:

| Resolutions     | Required Bandwidth (H264) | Required Bandwidth (H265) |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1280x720 (HD)   | 3Mbps                     | 1.5Mbps                   |
| 1920x1080 (FHD) | 6Mbps                     | 3Mbps                     |
| 3840x2160 (UHD) | 25Mbps                    | 12Mbps                    |
| 4096x2160 (4K)  | 32Mbps                    | 15Mbps                    |

Taking above table into account, the logic responsible for the proactive strategy can look like:

```javascript
player.addEventListener("representationchange", function (event) {
  // specifies how big bandwidth is required for the current quality
  var representationBandwidth = event.representation.bandwidth;
  // player.abr.targetBuffer is 20 by default
  var targetBuffer = player.abr.targetBuffer;

  // SD
  if (representationBandwidth < 3000000) {
    targetBuffer = 20;
  } else if (
    representationBandwidth > 3000000 &&
    representationBandwidth < 6000000
  ) {
    // HD
    targetBuffer = 10;
  } else if (representationBandwidth > 6000000) {
    //FHD, UHD, 4K
    targetBuffer = 5;
  }

  player.abr.targetBuffer = targetBuffer;
  console.log(
    "representationchange - updated player.abr.targetBuffer: " +
      player.abr.targetBuffer
  );
});
```

Please note that the above numbers should be adjusted depending on the video content used.
