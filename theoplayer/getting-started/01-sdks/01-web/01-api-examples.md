# API examples

This page contains an overview of examples, demonstrating the capabilities of the THEOplayer API and custom JavaScript. With these examples, we try to explain the fundamentals of how to use our API:

- Accessing **player properties** and using **methods** (e.g. _currentTime_, _duration_, ...) ,

- Hooking to **events**,

- Inserting DOM-elements (buttons, text, ...) in the **UI**

- ...

The examples are sorted per subject, and a link can re-appear if it also relates to another subject.
New examples will be added from time to time, when new use cases arise, or when new developments happen.

If you are new to THEOplayer, please read our [Getting Started on Web](./00-getting-started.mdx) or our [API pages](pathname:///theoplayer/v9/api-reference/web/).
