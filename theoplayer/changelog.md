## 🚀 8.6.3 (2024/12/12)

### Web

#### ⚡ Improvements

- Improved the UI for HESP streams when returning back to a muted tab on Chromium-based browsers.
- Improved playback of THEOlive streams on Vizio devices.

### tvOS

#### ✨ Features

- Added a THEOlive integration with a `TheoLiveSource` to play [THEOlive](https://theo.live) channels using a THEOplayer on tvOS.

## 🚀 8.6.2 (2024/12/10)

### General

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue on Web and Android on content protected DASH streams where the player tries to access adaptation sets that the DRM server did not return a key for.

### Web

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where using an empty string as the token with DRM integration `vudrm` would cause an error.

### iOS

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where `THEOplayer.autoplay` was not being set correctly.

## 🚀 8.6.1 (2024/12/05)

### iOS

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where legacy player licenses without the features property were rejected.

## 🚀 8.6.0 (2024/12/04)

### General

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where the minimum and maximum playback rate in the latency configuration for an HESP stream were incorrectly reset after a buffer stall.
- Fixed an issue where no DRM license requests were sent for a DASH stream for which adaptation set switching is enabled and the PSSH does not appear inside the initialization segment. This relates to both web and Android.

### Web

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Removed currentServerLiveTime and currentLatency from experimental HESP API in favor of the latency API.

#### ✨ Features

- Added ad events for alternative THEOads ad sources.
- Exposed `description` on `GoogleImaAd`.
- Added the `player.addTextTrack()` API to be able to create an external text track. This track is mutable and can be filled with cues, allowing 3rd parties to add subtitles to the player in real-time.
- Added support for passing a `latencyConfiguration` in HESP and THEOlive sources.

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where the `adend` and `adbreakend` events were not dispatched correctly when a THEOads adbreak ended.

### Officially announcing THEOplayer 8.0
Introducing a major version bump to THEOplayer 8.0. This version officially releases all the improvements and developments THEOplayer has achieved since version 7.0.

THEOplayer 8.0 is **backwards compatible for most features but includes some breaking changes per SDK**. Please review them carefully in the respective changelog for your SDK.

- THEOplayer 8.0 is the first official release with support for [THEOads](https://www.theoplayer.com/product/theoads), our new product for delivering seamless and novel ad experiences through Server Guided Ad Insertion.  

- The Custom Server Side Ad Insertion API allows custom SSAI integrations to control the player Ad API, and forms the basis for our new Yospace connectors for [Web](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/connectors/web/yospace/), [Android](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/connectors/android/yospace/) and [iOS](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/connectors/ios/yospace/) as well as our upcoming Edgio Uplynk connectors.

- The Latency Manager API allows fine-tuned control over live and low-latency playback for DASH, HLS and HESP, available on Web and Android.

For more info on navigating our breaking changes, take a look at our migration guides for [Web](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/web/migrating-to-theoplayer-8/), [Android](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/android/migrating-to-theoplayer-8/) and [iOS](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/migrating-to-theoplayer-8/).

### General

### Web

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Removed the Yospace pre-integration in favor of the new [Yospace web connector](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/connectors/web/yospace/).
- Removed the Conviva pre-integration in favor of the new [Conviva web connector](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/connectors/web/conviva/).
- Removed the empty `player.analytics` API.
- Renamed the default integration for client-side VAST and VMAP ads from `'theo'` to `'csai'`. Ad descriptions that don't specify an [integration](https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/v8/api-reference/web/interfaces/AdDescription.html#integration) or use the old name will continue to work, but will have their integration replaced with `'csai'` in the API. The new name was chosen to avoid confusion with our new THEOads solution for server-guided ad insertion.

### Android

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Removed deprecated UIConfiguration.
- Removed deprecated `AdIntegrationKind.DEFAULT`.
- Removed deprecated `HlsPlaybackConfiguration.isUseLegacy` flag.

#### ⚡ Improvements

- Make `CachingTaskList#getTaskById(String)` return `null` if no match is found.

### iOS

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Due to low number of usage of iOS 12, we decided to raise the minimum supported version of our iOS SDK to 13.0. This decision was based on metrics provided by Apple's iOS usage measures by devices that transacted on the App Store. For more info check `https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/`.
- Removed deprecated `GoogleIMAAdsConfiguration` and `GoogleIMAConfigurationBuilder` APIs. Use `IMASettings` instead and pass it to `GoogleIMAIntegrationFactory.createIntegration`. For more info check https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/migrating-to-theoplayer-8/
- Removed deprecated `GoogleDAIAdsConfiguration` and `GoogleDAIAdsConfigurationBuilder` APIs. Use `IMASettings` instead and pass it to `GoogleIMAIntegrationFactory.createIntegration`. For more info check https://www.theoplayer.com/docs/theoplayer/getting-started/sdks/ios/migrating-to-theoplayer-8/
- Removed deprecated `AdsConfiguration` and `AdPreloadType` APIs.

- Removed deprecated `UIConfiguration` API.
- Removed deprecated `setPreload` and `setPlaybackRate` APIs. Use `preload` and `playbackRate` setters respectively.
- Removed deprecated `THEOplayerCastHelper` API. Use `THEOplayerGoogleCastIntegration.CastIntegrationHelper` instead.
- Changed `CompanionAd.width` and `CompanionAd.height` types from `Int?` to `Int`.
- Changed `Ad.adBreak` type from `AdBreak` to `AdBreak?`. Changed `Ad.companions` type from `[CompanionAd?]` to `[CompanionAd]`.
- Removed deprecated `THEOplayerConfiguration.init` API. Use `THEOplayerConfigurationBuilder` instead.

- Removed unused `AdIntegration.theo` enum case in preparation for the new THEOads API.

#### 👎 Deprecations

- Deprecating all THEOplayer Objective-C API support. Existing APIs will still continue to work until next major release, but additional support for new APIs will discontinue. When it was introduced, the goal of the Objective-C APIs was to provide bindings to bridge our native SDK to React Native. Over time that became unneeded as Swift became capable of accomplishing the goal. Please contact us for support in case your codebase relies on the Objective-C APIs.

### tvOS

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Raising the tvOS mimimum supported version of our tvOS SDK to 13.0 for consistency with iOS version.

#### 👎 Deprecations

## 🚀 7.0.0 (2024/04/03)
### Officially announcing THEOplayer 7.0
Introducing a major version bump to THEOplayer 7.0. This version officially releases all the improvements and developments THEOplayer has achieved since version 6.0.

THEOplayer 7.0 is **backwards compatible for most features but includes some breaking changes per SDK**. Please review them carefully in the respective changelog for your SDK.

- Further improvements to accelerate monetization of your FAST/AVOD service by enabling seamless **THEO Ads integration on Chromecast CAF (v3) receivers**. (Currently available on Web)

- A **smaller and more efficient Android and iOS player** thanks to refactorings and further modularization.

- Added experimental support for using [`ManagedMediaSource` in iOS Safari](https://webkit.org/blog/14735/webkit-features-in-safari-17-1/). This brings **MPEG-DASH and HESP support to iOS**, along with manual quality selection for HLS streams. (Requires iOS 17.1 or higher.)

- Added conformance to **Apple's new privacy policy for API usage**.

- **Performance optimizations** to help our **React Native** and **Flutter SDK**s run smoothly on all devices.


### General

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- Changed the Chromecast default app ID on all platforms to our THEOplayer Chromecast CAF receiver with app ID `8E80B9CE`. If you prefer the previous default web behavior which uses our Chromecast V2 receiver, you can set the `ChromecastConfiguration.appID` to `1ADD53F3`. For our Android and iOS SDKs, we officially only support Chromecast CAF receivers. If you prefer to use the default Google Chromecast CAF receiver instead, you can set the app ID to `CC1AD845`.
- In an effort to align with the changes made by Apple regarding the [App Store publishing policy](https://developer.apple.com/news/upcoming-requirements/?id=04292024a), starting from THEOplayer 7.0 we will distribute our SDK builds using Xcode 15. Effectively, this means that developing a client application using THEOplayer iOS/tvOS SDK will require a minimum version of Xcode 15.

    - This first release supports linear VAST ads using the THEO Ads integration.
      (Server-side ads, non-linear ads, VMAP ads, or ads using the Google IMA integration are not yet supported.)
    - Scheduling additional ads while casting using `player.ads.schedule()` is not supported.
    - The Chromecast receiver must be based on the Chromecast CAF v3 SDK,
      such as [Styled Media Receiver](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/web_receiver#styled_media_web_receiver)s,
      the [Default Media Receiver](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/web_receiver#default_media_web_receiver),
      or any [Custom Receiver](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/web_receiver#custom_web_receiver)
      built with the THEOplayer Chromecast CAF SDK.
      (Receivers based on the [Cast Receiver v2 SDK](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/migrate_v2/receiver) are not supported.)

## 🚀 6.0.0 (2023/09/13)
### Officially announcing THEOplayer 6.0
Introducing a major version bump to THEOplayer 6.0. This version officially releases all the improvements and developments THEOplayer has achieved since version 5.0.

THEOplayer 6.0 is **backwards compatible for most features but includes some breaking changes per SDK**. Please review them carefully in the respective changelog for your SDK.

- Further improvements to accelerate monetization of your FAST/AVOD service, including **new ad connectors and advertisement capabilities in our Open Video UI**.

- A **smaller and more efficient web player** thanks to ESM modules.

- **Updated analytics connectors** to ensure you are seeing what’s happening.

- **Increased performance** through new features, optimizations of our analytics connectors and further reductions in startup time.

**The Legacy (WebView-based) Android and iOS SDKs are officially reaching end of life.** No further fixes will be provided for those SDKs (previously included in THEOplayer 4.12.x hotfixes). Please contact our support if you have further questions or follow our migrations guides on the [THEOportal pages](https://docs.theoplayer.com/).

### Web

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- `import { Player } from 'theoplayer'` now results in a JavaScript module using ES2017 syntax, which won't work when loaded inside older browsers (such as old smart TVs). If you still need to support such older browsers, you can import the old JavaScript file directly with `import { Player } from 'theoplayer/THEOplayer.js'`.
- The player will now start playback at a medium bitrate quality (up to 2.5 Mbps) instead of the lowest bitrate quality, if it doesn't yet have a network speed estimate from a prior playback session. This can be overridden by setting `player.abr.strategy` [(documentation)](https://docs.theoplayer.com/api-reference/web/theoplayer.abrconfiguration.md#strategy).
- Removed `source.hls.useLegacy`. The legacy HLS pipeline has been removed, all HLS streams will now use the new HLS pipeline.

#### ✨ Features

- Added support for importing THEOplayer as a [JavaScript module ("ESM")](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).
    - Added `THEOplayer.esm.js` and `THEOplayer.chromeless.esm.js`.
        - These provide the THEOplayer API using `export` statements instead of using a global `THEOplayer` variable.
            This makes them appropriate to use with modern bundlers that consume ESM, such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
            [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). They can also be used directly in
            modern browsers using `<script type="module">`.
        - These versions use ES2017 syntax (rather than ES5 syntax), targeting more modern browsers. This results in smaller
            and faster code, by using more of the native JavaScript features provided by the browser itself.
    - Added an `exports` field to `package.json` on npm. These define [subpath exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/packages.html#subpath-exports)
        for the chromeless player and the UI player, supporting both CommonJS and ESM.
        - `import { Player } from 'theoplayer'`: imports the UI player.
        - `import { ChromelessPlayer } from 'theoplayer/chromeless'`: imports the chromeless player only.
            This is intended to replace explicit imports for `theoplayer/THEOplayer.chromeless`.
    - If you use TypeScript in your project, we recommend setting [`moduleResolution`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution)
        to `bundler`, `node16` or `nodenext` in your `tsconfig.json` to correctly resolve these subpath exports.

### Web

#### ✨ Features

- Added `source.abr.restrictToPlayerSize`, to control whether the ABR algorithm should only select qualities whose resolution fits within the player's size.
- Added support for the `PRECISE` attribute in an HLS `#EXT-X-START` tag. This removes the limitation from THEOplayer 4.7.0, so a missing `PRECISE` attribute is now treated as `PRECISE=NO` to conform with the HLS specification.

## 🚀 4.0.0 (2022/08/31)

### Officially announcing THEOplayer 4.0
Introducing a major version bump to THEOplayer 4.0. This version officially releases all the improvements and developments THEOplayer has achieved since version 3.0. THEOplayer 4.0 is **backwards compatible for most features but includes some breaking changes per SDK**. Please review them carefully in the respective changelog for your SDK.

- **Android SDK 4.0**: We’ve added support for MPEG-TS, progressive MP4, casting and CSAI to our new high-performing [Android pipeline](https://docs.theoplayer.com/getting-started/01-sdks/02-android/00-getting-started.md).

- **LCEVC support**: You can now play back [LCEVC-enabled](https://docs.theoplayer.com/getting-started/01-sdks/01-web/09-how-to-play-an-lcevc-source-with-theoplayer.md) streams to deliver a richer viewer experience or to achieve bandwidth savings.

- **AWS MediaTailor**: Leverage the AWS MediaTailor [integration](https://docs.theoplayer.com/how-to-guides/05-integrations/05-mediatailor.md) and easily track your client-side events cross-platform to discover how viewers interact with your ads.

- **New HLS pipeline**: We’ve combined both HLS and LL-HLS features in our new HLS pipeline and additionally increased performance and stability on smart TVs and older devices.

- **React Native SDK**: MP4 playback is available, thumbnail support has been added to the React Native [sample app](https://www.theoplayer.com/e3t/Ctc/I2+113/cfLZc04/VWfQ7T1Yjx1NVnM_5f4sB9s-W5wYw0_4PbdFyN2L_pB73q3phV1-WJV7CgRMJW6vyfHx1XwgLSW5cM8Gt5_Qh-VW7RRD1G6Y3tbhW7ZxtwG7P-lFnW5sl_wD8f-CVJN2sVHXVcydThW2Y_z7x27m_YRW5tlbHs365lTZW5_fK3g76zfgkW797kxh3Vj8_2W6tmkvp84dyDVW2dQQ258-620zW488Cgx89K4g7W4KG8jp2X7SNKW676j8x6JH3YHW3l_rc93BxgnrW2MtWPt8_JC_5W2sjsC11FDwsyW8TM85H4vvghVW8W45D83wYTDKVNTD6V5vp2M6W6sS28J7zg68ZW7lcnGT3v9rw0N94PjjHPbdlgW9gXdbM359kD3VdP9lK40_4LFN5xGHpnMnwwFW28xwTq2yn4Ny39xJ1) on Github and we’ve updated our [documentation](https://www.theoplayer.com/e3t/Ctc/I2+113/cfLZc04/VWfQ7T1Yjx1NVnM_5f4sB9s-W5wYw0_4PbdFyN2L_pBr3q3pBV1-WJV7CgJhNW91-gCn4PGC-_Vbpghm96wBJlVsvD-s3gtxfwN73qDdW6xxl9N5xvKQJcwKRpW62zXCH4v60bFW6MnKWq1TZjg4W91rSZ-1K309DW8BD-8R7w_htSW3zP1_Q4LJvCVW8vN1Hr5HNLqKW3Gm4JJ97Py8-W2D80_w3zZMM0W5KRxzJ6-ZGrPW4qVp1W3Mjv2mV7NPq12ypdF3W1P5mzb8-0lP8W2kq8nN6JhNgRVQwKbG48GpBPW8nfyq66bRsKWW4BncWC8WM5DlW9c89sz6X9V14N8657CbnNN63N5B8ZfsYMNnvV2NJsj5gGYQQVZKZ09762mbMW6kYg9N1Wn4qWW12p8zf3zZXlrW4KDs0J7w4ytQW5lRmXt4MbRj13hzf1) to make sure you can easily get started!

### General

#### 💥 Breaking Changes

- The new HLS pipeline is now enabled by default. Formerly known as "the LL-HLS pipeline", this pipeline adds support for low-latency HLS streaming, with full support for Widevine, PlayReady and FairPlay DRM. (If you prefer to stay on the old pipeline for now and migrate later, you can enable the `hls-legacy` feature flag on your SDK and set `source.hls.useLegacy` to `true` when configuring [your source](https://docs.theoplayer.com/api-reference/web/theoplayer.basesource.md).)
- ID3 cues now have their `startTime` set to the dispatch time, and their `endTime` set to the dispatch time of the next ID3 tag. Previously, their `endTime` was equal to the dispatch time and their `startTime` was always 0, which rendered `TextTrack.activeCues` useless. Users who want to observe ID3 cue activations should now use the `enter` event (instead of the `exit` event), or alternatively use the `cuechange` event on the containing text track.

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where the player would stall during live DASH playback that contained DRM when the entire availability window suddenly contained no DRM.
- Fixed an issue with AES-128 decryption using the new LL-HLS pipeline where the player would incorrectly parse the initialization vector.

### Web

#### 💥 Breaking Changes and known limitations

- Removed the deprecated DRM processor APIs, i.e.: `KeySystemConfiguration.certificateRequestProcessor`, `.certificateResponseProcessor`, `.licenseRequestProcessor` and `.licenseResponseProcessor`. Use the Content Protection Integration API instead: https://docs.theoplayer.com/api-reference/web/theoplayer.registercontentprotectionintegration.md
- The new HLS pipeline requires the HLS master playlist to correctly list all used audio and video codecs in the CODECS attribute of the #EXT-X-STREAM-INF tags. Otherwise, the player may fail to start playback or fail to play the audio or video track. Notably, when setting the source directly to an HLS media playlist (without a master playlist), the player may fail to play the audio track.
- Playing an HLS stream with AES-128 full-segment encryption requires the web page to be served over HTTPS.
- The new HLS pipeline performs soft quality switches, meaning that it plays the current buffer out before showing the quality switch (as opposed to rebuilding the buffer in the new quality).

#### ✨ Features

- Added automatic recovery when the player's buffer becomes too full. When the player fails to buffer the next segment because there's no more room in its buffer, it will now wait until the playhead has advanced further before retrying this segment. See `player.abr.maxBufferLength` for more information. This is currently only supported for MPEG-DASH streams.
- Added support for loading cached streams in the LL-HLS pipeline using the Cache API.
- Allow changing the UI language dynamically with `player.ui.language(languageCode)`.
- Added support for clickthroughs in Verizon Media Ads.
- Added support for default classes in WebVTT. Tags such as `<c.yellow>` now receive a default color according to https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/#default-classes.
- Added basic support for MP3 audio in the new HLS pipeline.

#### 🐛 Issues

- Fixed an issue where certain nested `<div>` elements inside a TTML subtitle were not rendered.
- Fixed an issue which caused the player to be stuck in an infinite loop on the end of a discontinuity with our legacy HLS pipeline.
- Fixed an issue where `<p>` tags in TTML subtitles did not correctly inherit the `tts:textAlign` property from their parent region's style.
- Fixed an issue where FairPlay streams would still use the new HLS pipeline instead of native playback on Safari.
- Fixed an issue where the browser could run out of memory over time while playing an HLS stream with high-resolution MPEG-TS segments in the new HLS pipeline.

### Android
