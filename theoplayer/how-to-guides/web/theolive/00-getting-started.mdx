import Intro from '../../shared/theolive/_getting-started-intro.mdx';

<Intro />

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](../../../getting-started/01-sdks/01-web/00-getting-started.mdx)
   to set up THEOplayer in your web app or website.
2. Add a THEOlive source to your player's source.

### Add a THEOlive source

After setting up your THEOplayer on your web page, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `THEOliveSource`.
You'll need a THEOlive channel ID:

```javascript
const player = new THEOplayer.Player(element, configuration);
player.source = {
  sources: {
    integration: 'theolive',
    src: 'your-channel-id',
  },
};
```

### Add configuration

Optionally, you can provide additional configuration to the player, specific for THEOlive streams. To
configure these settings, add a `theolive` property to the player configuration. For an exhaustive list of these options,
please visit the [documentation](pathname:///theoplayer/v8/api-reference/web/interfaces/TheoLiveConfiguration.html).

```javascript
var player = new THEOplayer.Player(element, {
  license: 'your-license',
  // This is needed for fallback to work properly
  retryConfiguration: {
    maxRetries: 6,
  },
  theoLive: {
    externalSessionId: 'my-external-session-id',
    fallbackEnabled: true,
  },
});
```
