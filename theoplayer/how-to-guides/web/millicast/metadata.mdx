# Frame metadata with Millicast on Web

In addition to streaming audio and video, Millicast also supports inserting additional metadata about what is happening
in the stream. This is known as _Frame Metadata_, which allows for embedding and extracting custom application data
with frame-level accuracy. For example, this can be used to transport timecodes, bounding boxes, and overlays.

## Enable metadata on your Millicast source

First, follow [our Getting Started with Millicast on Web guide](./getting-started.mdx)
to set up Millicast with THEOplayer in your web app or website.

Then, enable the `metadata` option in your [Millicast source's `connectOptions`](./getting-started.mdx#add-configuration)
in order to receive frame metadata:

```javascript
player.source = {
  sources: {
    type: 'millicast',
    /* ... */
    connectOptions: {
      // highlight-next-line
      metadata: true,
    },
  },
};
```

## Listen for metadata text track events

THEOplayer exposes Millicast metadata as cues on a metadata text track. First, listen for the `addtrack` event
to receive the Millicast metadata track. Then, listen for the `entercue` event to be notified whenever new metadata
is added to the track.

```javascript
player.textTracks.addEventListener('addtrack', function (addTrackEvent) {
  const track = addTrackEvent.track;
  if (track.kind === 'metadata' && track.type === 'millicast') {
    track.addEventListener('entercue', function (event) {
      const cue = event.cue;
      console.log(`Received frame metadata at timecode ${cue.timecode} with data:`, cue.unregistered);
    });
  }
});
```

See [our guide on how to detect active text track cues](../../10-texttrack/08-how-to-detect-active-text-track-cues.md)
for more information.
