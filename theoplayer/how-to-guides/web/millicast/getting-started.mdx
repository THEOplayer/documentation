<Intro />

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](../../../getting-started/01-sdks/01-web/00-getting-started.mdx)
   to set up THEOplayer in your web app or website.
   The Millicast integration is available in the main [theoplayer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/theoplayer) package on npm.
2. Add a Millicast source to your player's source.

### Add a Millicast source

After setting up your THEOplayer on your web page, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `MillicastSource`.
You'll need a Millicast account ID and stream name to identify your Millicast stream:

```javascript
const player = new THEOplayer.Player(element, configuration);
player.source = {
  sources: {
    type: 'millicast',
    streamName: 'multiview',
    streamAccountId: 'k9Mwad',
  },
};
```
