# Getting started with Millicast on Web

import Intro from '../../shared/millicast/_getting-started-intro.mdx';

<Intro />

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](../../../getting-started/01-sdks/01-web/00-getting-started.mdx)
   to set up THEOplayer in your web app or website.
   The Millicast integration is available in the main [theoplayer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/theoplayer) package on npm.
2. Add a Millicast source to your player's source.

### Add a Millicast source

After setting up your THEOplayer on your web page, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `MillicastSource`.
You'll need a Millicast account ID and stream name to identify your Millicast stream:

```javascript
const player = new THEOplayer.Player(element, configuration);
player.source = {
  sources: {
    type: 'millicast',
    src: 'multiview',
    streamAccountId: 'k9Mwad',
  },
};
```

### Add configuration

Optionally, you can provide additional configuration to the source, specific for working with Millicast streams. To
configure these settings, add a `connectOptions` property to the source object and specify the options.

In the example below, the configuration is used to disable any audio from the Millicast stream.
For an exhaustive list of these options, visit the
[documentation](https://millicast.github.io/millicast-sdk/View.html#connect).

```javascript
player.source = {
  sources: {
    type: 'millicast',
    ...,
    connectOptions: {
      disableAudio: true,
      ...
    }
  },
};
```
