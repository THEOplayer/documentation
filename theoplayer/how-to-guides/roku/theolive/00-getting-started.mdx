# Getting started with THEOlive on Roku

import Intro from '/theolive/getting-started.mdx';

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](../../../getting-started/01-sdks/09-roku/00-getting-started.mdx)
   to set up THEOplayer in your Roku app.
2. Add a THEOlive source to your player's source.

### Add a THEOlive source

After setting up your THEOplayer on your App, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `THEOliveSource`.
You'll need a THEOlive channel ID:

```brightscript
m.THEOsdk.source = {
        "live": true,
        "sources": {
          "src": "your-channel-id",
          "type": "theolive"
        }
    }
```

Please note that the playlist feature cannot be used with THEOlive. On Roku the THEOlive source falls back to the HLS stream.

### Configure THEOlive

If your THEOlive source does not use the default discovery URL (https://discovery.theo.live/v2/publications/), then you will need to specify one or more discovery URLs. On the player configuration object, you may add in one or more discovery URLs using the `theoLive` property on the player configuration.

```brightscript
playerConfiguration = {
  license: "<YOUR_LICENSE_HERE>",
  theoLive: {
    discoveryUrls: ["https://my.domain.com/discovery/v2/distributions", "https://my.alt.domain.com/discovery/v2/distributions" ]
  }
}
m.player.callFunc("configure", playerConfiguration)
```

Additionally, if you would like to provide an external ID to track the session, you may add it to the `theoLive` configuration as well:

```brightscript
...
  theoLive: {
    discoveryUrls: ["https://my.domain.com/discovery/v2/distributions", "https://my.alt.domain.com/discovery/v2/distributions" ],
    externalSessionId: "my-unique-id"
  }
...
```
