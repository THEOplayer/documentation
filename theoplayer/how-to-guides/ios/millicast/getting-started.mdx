## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](../../../getting-started/01-sdks/03-ios/00-getting-started.md)
   to set up THEOplayer in your iOS app.
2. Add the `THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast` dependency to your project.
3. Add the `THEOplayerMillicastIntegration` to the player.
4. Add a `MillicastSource` to your player's source.

### Add the `THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast` dependency

Add the Millicast integration as a dependency in to your project:

   <Tabs queryString="lang">
      <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
      <TabItem value="spm" label="Swift Package Manager">
       ```swift
       .package(url: "https://github.com/theoplayer/theoplayer-sdk-spm.git", from: "8.10.0")
       .product(name: "THEOplayerMillicastIntegration", package: "theoplayer-sdk-spm")
       ```
       </TabItem>
       <TabItem value="cocoapods" label="Cocoapods">
       ```ruby
       pod 'THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast', '~> 8.10.0'
       ```
       </TabItem>
       <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
   </Tabs>

### Add the Millicast integration to the player

First import the integration into your project:

```swift
import THEOplayerMillicastIntegration
```

Create and add the `THEOplayerMillicastIntegration` to your `THEOplayer`:

```swift
let millicastIntegration = MillicastIntegrationFactory.createIntegration()
theoplayer.addIntegration(millicastIntegration)
```

### Add a `MillicastSource`

After setting up a `THEOplayer` in your app, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `MillicastSource`.
You'll need a Millicast account ID and stream name to identify your Millicast stream:

```swift
let millicastSource = SourceDescription(source: MillicastSource(streamName: "multiview", accountID: "k9Mwad"))
theoplayer.source = millicastSource
```

Make sure to replace the above `streamName` and `accountID` with your own. If your source is a secure stream, then you will
also need to add a subscriber token to the source as follows:

```swift
MillicastSource(streamName: ..., accountID: ..., token: "Your token")
```
