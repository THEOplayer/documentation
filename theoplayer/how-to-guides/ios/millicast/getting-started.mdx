<Intro />

## Usage

1. Follow [our Getting Started guide](../../../getting-started/01-sdks/03-ios/00-getting-started.md)
   to set up THEOplayer in your Android app.
2. Add the `THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast` dependency to your project's Podfile.
3. Add the `MillicastIntegration` to the player.
4. Add a `MillicastSource` to your player's source.

### Add the `integration-millicast` dependency

Add the Millicast integration to your project's `Podfile`, as demonstrated below:
```
pod 'THEOplayer-Integration-Millicast'
```

### Add the Millicast integration to the player

First import the integration into your project: 
```
import THEOplayerMillicastIntegration
```

Create and add the `MillicastIntegration` to your `THEOplayer`:

```swift
let millicastIntegration = MillicastIntegrationFactory.createMillicastIntegration()
theoplayer.addIntegration(millicastIntegration)
```

### Add a `MillicastSource`

After setting up a `THEOplayer` in your app, set its source to a `SourceDescription` containing a `MillicastSource`.
You'll need a Millicast account ID and stream name to identify your Millicast stream:

```swift
let millicastSource = SourceDescription(source: MillicastSource(streamName: "multiview", accountID: "k9Mwad"))
theoplayer.source = millicastSource
```

Make sure to replace the above `streamName` and `accountID` with your own. If your source is a secure stream, then you will
also need to add a subscriber token to the source as follows:
```swift
MillicastSource(streamName: ..., accountID: ..., token: "Your token")
```
