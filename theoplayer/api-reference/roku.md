To play videos protected using VUDRM, you need to supply a token. Replace the token `vualto-demo|2018-06-19T09:18:24Z|YSnJPmEceo` in the code below with your own token as well as the associated values of the keys `src` and `licenseUrl`.

```
vuDrmSource = {
  sources: [
    {
      src: "https://d1chyo78gdexn4.cloudfront.net/vualto-demo/big-buck-bunny/big-buck-bunny.ism/manifest.mpd"
      type: "application/dash+xml"
      contentProtection: {
        integration: "widevine"
        licenseUrl: "https://widevine-proxy.drm.technology/proxy"
      }
    }
  ]
  drmHttpAgentHeaders: {
    "x-vudrm-token": "vualto-demo|2018-06-19T09:18:24Z|YSnJPmEceo"
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }

## Events

The event consists of:

- date (timestamp) of occurrence
- type (string) of the event
- extra data

There are several player events being emitted.

- `addedaudiotrack`: Fired when audio track has been added
- `addedtexttrack`: Fired when text track has been added
- `bitratechange`: Fired when the bitrate changes, the extra data emitted is the bitrate
- `canplay`: Fired when the player can resume playback of the media data, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `canplaythrough`: Fired when the player can resume playback of the media data and buffering is unlikely, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `destroy`: Fired when the the player is destroyed, there is no extra data emitted along
- `durationchange`: Fired when the duration changes, the extra data emitted is the duration
- `emptied`: Fired when the player's source is cleared, there is no extra data emitted along
- `ended`: Fired when playback has stopped because the end of the media resource was reached, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `error`: Fired when an error occurs, the extra data emitted is an associative array e.g.:

```brightscript
{
    "error": "<string:error>",
    "errorObject": {
        "code": <integer:code>,
        "message": <string:message>
    }
}
```

- `loadeddata`: Fired when the player can render the media data at the current playback position for the first time, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `loadedmetadata`: Fired when the player determines the duration and dimensions of the media resource, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `pause`: Fired when the "paused" changes to true, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `play`: Fired when the "paused" changes to false, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `playing`: Fired when playback is ready to start after having been paused or delayed due to lack of media data, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `seeked`: Fired when the "seeking" changes to false after the current playback position was changed, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `seeking`: Fired when "seeking" changes to true, and the player has started seeking to a new position, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
- `sourcechange`: Fired when the player's source changes, the extra data emitted is an associative array e.g.:

```brightscript
{
    "source": {
        "sources": [
            {
                "liveOffset": 4,
                "nativeUiRendering": false,
                "contentProtection": {
                    "drmParams": {
                        KeySystem: "widevine"
                        licenseServerURL: "https://example.com/license"
                    }
                },
                "src": https://example.com/stream.mpd,
                "type": "dash"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

- `timeupdate`: Fired when the current playback position changed as part of normal playback or in an especially interesting way, for example discontinuously, the extra data emitted is the currentTime
